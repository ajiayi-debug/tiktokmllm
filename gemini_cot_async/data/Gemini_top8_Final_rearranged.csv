0008-0,"The main difference is that the first two people only tap the bottle cap with an object, resulting in no change, while the last person taps the cap, performs a subsequent hand gesture, and achieves an effect where the entire bottle vanishes (likely through video editing or a magic trick), leaving only the liquid momentarily suspended. The first two attempt a physical action on the cap; the last performs an illusion affecting the whole bottle."
0008-1,"Unlike the others who successfully open their bottles by tapping the neck/shoulder area with a hard object on the first try, the last person initially fails using different methods (tapping with soft paper, tapping the side of the bottle with his fist). His final action involves waving his hand over the bottle without direct contact, resulting in the cap coming off, which appears to be a trick rather than the physical method used by the others."
0008-2,"Yes, the last person opened the bottle without using a knife. He tapped the cap with a chopstick-like object, and then the cap vanished after a hand gesture, suggesting a visual trick or video editing rather than a physical opening with a knife."
0008-3,"**No, the last person did not open the bottle with a knife.** They initially tapped the cap with a thin object (like a chopstick), which didn't work. The cap's removal afterwards appears to be a trick or video edit, not a physical opening with an object. The first two people did fail their attempts."

0012-0,"**4**

**Explanation:** The video first shows one figure walking, and later displays a group shot clearly showing four distinct figures dressed as robots posing together. The figure shown walking initially is one of the four in the group shot."
0012-1,"**Answer:** 4
**Explanation:** The video clearly shows four distinct individuals styled as humanoid robots standing together on display (starting around 0:03). The camera pans across all four: one in white/blue, one in silver/grey, one in black/silver (blonde hair), and one in red/gold."
0012-2,"Yes, the video displays four robot figures in total. Initially, one robot (white and blue) is shown walking. Later, it joins three others (metallic grey, black, and red/gold) on a stage, making a total of four visible together."
0012-3,"**No**, the video shows more than two robot figures. There is a scene where at least four distinct figures resembling robots are lined up together on a stage."

0016-0,"**Answer:**

The image is an optical illusion, and the person can be perceived as facing in two different directions:

1.  **Facing Forward (slightly to the viewer's left):** This perception focuses on the visible eye looking out and the ear on the left.
2.  **Facing Right (in profile):** This perception focuses on the silhouette formed by the forehead, nose, lips, and chin on the right side of the image.

**Explanation:**

The illusion works because the features can be interpreted in two distinct ways. Depending on whether your brain prioritizes the eye and ear or the outline of the face, the perceived direction will switch."
0016-1,"The person is looking both **left** and **right**.

**Explanation:** This is an optical illusion. You can perceive a detailed face looking towards the right side of the frame, or you can perceive the left edge of that face as the silhouette profile of a different face looking towards the left side of the frame."
0016-2,"**Yes, the person appears to be facing both sideways and forward due to photo editing or digital manipulation.**

**Explanation:** This is an optical illusion, specifically an ambiguous figure. Photo editing techniques are used to cleverly merge features from a frontal view (like the left eye and ear) with features from a profile view (like the nose, lips, and chin outline) using shared contours, creating an image that the brain can interpret in two distinct ways."
0016-3,"**Answer:** Yes, the relatively symmetrical appearance of the visible white area representing the shirt/shoulders supports the interpretation of the man facing forward.

**Explanation:** This symmetry aligns with how a person's upper torso typically appears from a frontal perspective. When the viewer interprets the central facial features (like the eye) as looking forward, the balanced appearance of the shoulders reinforces this perception, making the forward-facing interpretation plausible within the optical illusion."
0016-7,B
0036-0,"The machine achieves rapid, thin slicing due to a combination of factors:

1.  **Multiple Sharp Blades:** The cutting disc has several (likely 2 or 3) very sharp blades. This multiplies the number of cuts made per single rotation of the disc.
2.  **Controlled Feed Rate:** The green conveyor belt pushes the zucchini into the blades at a steady, controlled speed.
3.  **Synergy of Speed and Feed:** The thinness of the slices is determined by the precise ratio between how fast the blades are moving when they contact the zucchini and how quickly the zucchini is fed forward. Even a moderate rotational speed, when combined with multiple blades and a specific feed rate, results in rapid, thin cuts.
4.  **Actual Speed:** The rotational speed (RPM) might also be faster than it visually appears due to camera frame rates."
0036-1,"The machine achieves rapid, thin slicing due to a combination of factors:

1.  **High Rotational Speed (RPM):** The cutting disc spins very quickly, much faster than it might appear initially.
2.  **Multiple Sharp Blades:** The disc has multiple, extremely sharp cutting edges.
3.  **Combined Effect:** The high RPM multiplied by the number of blades results in a very high number of cuts per second.
4.  **Controlled Feed Rate:** The conveyor belt pushes the zucchini forward at a precise speed, ensuring each slice is consistently thin as it meets the rapidly passing blades."
0036-2,"**No.**

The thinness of the zucchini slices is determined by the machine's mechanical design, specifically the rate at which the zucchini is fed into the path of the rotating blade (the feed rate). While the blades spin at high speed for efficient and clean cutting, the stroboscopic effect is merely a visual illusion related to how we perceive rapid motion and has no physical impact on the thickness of the slices produced."
0036-3,"Yes, the machine is able to cut the zucchini thinly primarily because of the sharpness of the blade.

**Explanation:**
A sharp blade is essential for making clean, precise cuts with minimal force. This allows it to sever the vegetable fibers efficiently, even when removing a very thin slice, without crushing or tearing the zucchini. While the machine's design determines the slice thickness setting, the sharpness ensures the blade can actually execute that thin cut cleanly. A dull blade would struggle to achieve such thin, uniform slices at any speed, likely resulting in mangled or crushed pieces."

0037-0,"Based on the visual effects listed, there are **8** distinct artificially edited parts in the video.

**Explanation:** Each listed item (shaking cup, T-pose, floating ball, pixelation, missing texture, ERROR text, miniature man, multiple balls) represents a separate visual effect added to the original footage to simulate a video game glitch."
0037-1,"**7 Sections:**

*   **Explanation:** The video demonstrates distinct types of simulated glitches sequentially, each representing a different form of artificial editing:
    1.  Red cup jittering/clipping (0:01)
    2.  Man jittering/clipping (0:04)
    3.  Man freezing in T-pose / Ball floating (0:06)
    4.  Man's texture becoming pixelated/corrupted (0:08)
    5.  Man's texture changing to ""missing texture"" pattern + ""ERROR"" text appearing (0:11)
    6.  Duplicate T-posing man appearing behind the cup (0:13)
    7.  Ping pong ball duplication/spam (0:16)"
0037-2,"Yes, the video is edited in multiple parts and uses visual effects to create the effect of video game glitches. This is evident from the unnatural shaking of the cup, the man instantly snapping into a T-pose, his appearance changing to pixels and then a missing texture pattern, the appearance of the ""ERROR"" text, the character duplication, and the erratic behavior of multiple ping pong balls, all of which are impossible without digital manipulation."
0037-3,"**No**, the video is **not** edited only in one part to create the effect of video game glitches.

**Explanation:** The video showcases a sequence of *different* glitch effects applied progressively throughout its duration. These include the cup shaking, the person T-posing, texture errors on the person, an ""ERROR"" text overlay appearing, and finally, duplication of the person and the ball. This demonstrates that multiple edits and effects were applied at various points in the video, not just in a single section."
0037-7,E
0038-0,"The last person was able to snap off the cap easily because tapping the bottle agitates the carbonated liquid, causing dissolved CO2 gas to rapidly come out of solution. This significantly increases the pressure inside the bottle neck, exerting a strong upward force on the cap and making it require much less external force to remove."
0038-1,"The last person succeeded by applying a sharp jolt near the bottle (hitting the table or a downward motion beside it) rather than just tapping the neck. This sudden impact transmitted a shockwave/pressure wave through the liquid, causing effects like cavitation (bubble collapse) or a rapid fluid momentum shift near the cap, generating sufficient upward force to overcome the seal. This technique is more effective than simply tapping the glass neck."
0038-2,"**Yes**, the last person successfully broke the bottle.

**Explanation:** Although the visual cut is quick, a distinct glass-shattering sound effect plays immediately after the last person performs the hand gesture towards the bottle, indicating the intended outcome was a successful break. This auditory cue confirms the action was completed."
0038-3,"**No**, the last person did not use a lighter. They used a piece of folded paper to tap the bottle cap, and the cap's removal appeared to be a visual trick or video edit, not the result of using the paper as a lever."
0038-7,C
0064-0,"The room went dark because the lamp, which was the only source of light in the room, was turned off. Given that another pair of eyes appears immediately after, it's implied that an unseen presence already in the room turned off the lamp after the character closed the door, creating suspense and setting up the scare."
0064-1,"Based on the animation, the room became dark because:

**An unseen entity, whose eyes appear immediately after, turned off the lamp.**

*   **Explanation:** The lamp was the only light source shown in the room. The moment the character shuts the door, the lamp extinguishes, and a second pair of eyes appears, strongly implying this entity caused the light to go out to reveal itself in the darkness."
0064-2,"**Yes**, the room went dark because the character slammed the door, causing the lamp to fall.

**Brief Explanation:** The video shows the character running into the bedroom and slamming the door. This action causes vibrations that knock the lamp off the nightstand, extinguishing the light and making the room dark."
0064-3,"**No.**

**Explanation:** The video shows the character running *past* the light switch in the hallway without touching it. The hallway light goes out *after* the character has passed the switch but *before* it reaches the bedroom and closes the bedroom door. The door closing event occurs in a different location (the bedroom) and is separate from the hallway light turning off."

0070-0,"The person in the video poured the water 2 times.

**Explanation:** The video shows the person pouring water once, pausing to think, and then pouring water a second time."
0070-1,"**Answer:** 2
**Explanation:** The person pours water from the green mug into the black mug twice. The first pour occurs between 0:01 and 0:06, followed by a pause, and the second pour begins around 0:08."
0070-2,"Yes, the person poured the water twice.

He poured water initially, paused while looking surprised and thoughtful as overlay images appeared, and then poured water from the green mug into the black mug a second time after pointing his finger."
0070-3,"**No**, the person pours water twice. They pour initially, pause, and then pour again."

0080-0,"The purpose of beating the balloon is to break the inner pouch containing vinegar, allowing it to mix with the baking soda. This initiates the chemical reaction that produces carbon dioxide gas, causing the balloon to self-inflate."
0080-1,"Hitting the balloon is necessary to break the inner pouch containing the vinegar. This allows the vinegar to mix with the baking soda inside the balloon, initiating the chemical reaction that produces carbon dioxide gas and causes the balloon to self-inflate."
0080-2,"Yes, the purpose of hitting the balloon is to break the inner container holding the vinegar, allowing it to mix with the baking soda. This causes a chemical reaction that rapidly inflates the balloon, creating a fun, interactive, self-inflating toy."
0080-3,"**Yes.** Hitting the balloon is likely intended to mix the internal vinegar and baking soda (shown being prepared earlier). This initiates a chemical reaction that produces carbon dioxide gas, rapidly inflating the balloon until it pops."
0080-7,E
0081-0,"Based on the video, the man likely puts his hand on his face due to slight **embarrassment or shyness**, possibly combined with **suppressing a laugh or smile** at the situation (doing a cute dance trend with a filter). He seems more reserved than the woman and the gesture appears as a brief moment of self-consciousness before joining in."
0081-1,"The man likely covers his face due to a combination of **embarrassment/shyness** and potentially **hiding laughter or a smile** before participating in the cute social media trend, feeling momentarily awkward or amused by the filter and music."
0081-2,"**Yes.** The man covering his face interrupted the filter's facial tracking on him, causing it to detect and apply itself to the girl's face instead."
0081-3,"**No**, the man's hand gesture to his face was not part of a synchronized dance move. His action occurred while the woman was performing a different gesture (pointing at herself), and it did not match the timing or style of her subsequent dance movements."

0083-0,"**Best Answer:** The video aims to convey the concept of **Ultimate Personalization and the Car as a Dynamic Fashion Accessory.**

**Explanation:** By showing the car instantly changing its color to perfectly match the outfits of different people walking by, the video emphasizes an advanced level of customization where the vehicle becomes an extension of the owner's personal style, adapting in real-time like a fashion accessory."
0083-1,"The daughter's repeated entries expose the mother's hypocrisy and growing secret affection for the dog, confirming the daughter's suspicions and comedically highlighting the common ""parent who didn't want the pet"" trope."
0083-2,"**Answer:** No.

**Explanation:** The video shows people reacting with surprise as a car parked on the street changes its color to match the outfits of different pedestrians walking past it. There is no daughter, mother, pet dog, or repeated entering of a room depicted in the video."
0083-3,"**Answer:** No

**Explanation:** The daughter announces the dog only once at the beginning of the video. Her subsequent appearances at the door are to catch her mother secretly liking and interacting with the dog after initially rejecting it, highlighting the comedic trope of the mother's contradictory behaviour, not to repeatedly announce the pet."

2.  **Couch**
3.  **Cardboard Box**
4.  **Near Doorway (Behind Dog)**"
0101-2,"**Answer:** No, the man does not teleport.
**Explanation:** The video uses editing techniques (like cuts and visual effects for the bookshelf scene) and physical hiding spots (inside the couch storage and the cardboard box) to create the illusion of him appearing in different places quickly, rather than actual teleportation."
0101-3,"**No.** The man first appears behind the bookshelf, then inside the couch, then inside the cardboard box, and finally reveals himself from under the blanket near the doorway. The question incorrectly swaps the order of the couch and the cardboard box."

0113-0,"**Answer:** 1 building and 1 water tower.
**Explanation:** The video shows the demolition of one conventional building (a glass skyscraper via implosion at 0:29) and one water tower (a brick structure knocked down by an excavator at 0:54)."
0113-1,"**One (1) building.**

**Explanation:** The video shows the controlled demolition of one glass skyscraper (0:30-0:38). While a water tower is also demolished (0:54-0:59), it is typically classified as a structure or tower, not a building in the conventional sense. Therefore, strictly counting ""buildings"", there is only one."
0113-2,"**No:** Only one building, a tall glass skyscraper, is shown being demolished (0:29-0:38). A brick water tower is also demolished (0:54-0:59), but a water tower is typically classified as a structure, not a building."

**Explanation:** In a gymnasium setting, three individuals coordinate their movements precisely to leap and tuck their bodies, allowing all of them to pass through the center of a single hoop at the same moment while airborne."
0133-1,"**Answer:** Three men jump simultaneously through a large hoop held by one of them.

**Explanation:** The final scene shows three men in a gym setting. One holds a large white hoop. All three jump in unison, and the hoop is passed under their feet and over their heads as they are airborne, before they land together."
0133-2,"**Yes.**

**Explanation:** The final scene clearly shows three men in a gym performing a coordinated stunt where they jump simultaneously through a single hula hoop held low to the ground."
0133-3,"**No.** The final scene shows three people sequentially jumping through a hula hoop. This demonstrates coordination, timing, and projectile motion, not the gyroscopic effect, which involves the stability and resistance to changes in orientation of a rapidly spinning object like the bicycle wheel shown earlier in the video."

0217-0,"**Answer:** 5 seconds.

**Explanation:** The time-lapse sequence in the video, showing the accelerated capillary action with the fast-moving clock hands, starts at the 0:09 mark and ends at the 0:14 mark. The duration is calculated by subtracting the start time from the end time (14 seconds - 9 seconds = 5 seconds)."
0217-1,"**Answer:** The exact duration of the capillary action demonstration shown in real time was **1 hour 30 minutes** (or **90 minutes**).

**Brief Explanation:** The alarm clock placed next to the experiment shows the time starting at approximately 10:10 when the paper towels are inserted and ending at approximately 11:40 when the sped-up (x8) segment concludes, indicating an elapsed real time of 1 hour and 30 minutes."
0217-2,"**Yes.**

The clock in the video starts at approximately 10:10 and ends at approximately 11:25, showing an elapsed time of 1 hour and 15 minutes during the time-lapse portion of the demonstration."
0217-3,"**Yes**, the clock placed in the scene explicitly shows a passage of approximately 2 hours (roughly 10:10 to 12:10), representing the real duration of the capillary action filmed for the time-lapse."

0242-0,"The two orange cats jumped away because the person suddenly leaned towards them while making a loud, sharp noise, which startled them."
0242-1,"The two orange cats leaped away because the person made a sudden, sharp snapping sound with their hand while also making a quick hand movement towards them. This combination of the abrupt noise and startling gesture frightened the cats."
0242-2,"**Yes**, the two orange cats jumped away immediately after the person in the red hat made a sudden, loud noise that sounds like a party blower, indicating they were startled by it."
0242-3,"Partially. One clip (0:04) clearly shows an orange cat being startled by a toy snake and jumping. However, another clip (0:07) shows an orange cat jumping, but the trigger appears to be a different object or the other cat's reaction, not a snake."

0248-0,"The person in the foreground is using a fine brush to paint a highlight, adding detail to what appears to be a large, hyperrealistic portrait painting featuring water droplets."
0248-1,"**Activity:** Painting a hyperrealistic portrait, specifically adding highlights to create realistic water effects.

**Explanation:** The person is using a fine paintbrush to apply small dabs of white paint onto a large, detailed painting of a woman's face. This action adds highlights to the depicted water droplets, enhancing the artwork's extreme realism."
0248-2,"Yes, the person in the foreground is painting a hyperrealistic image of a woman. The artist is using a fine brush to meticulously add highlights to painted water droplets on the large portrait, enhancing the realistic wet appearance of the subject's face and hair."
0248-3,"**No.**

This is a hyperrealistic painting. The video clearly shows an artist's hand using a fine brush to paint highlights onto one of the ""water droplets"" on the portrait's nose, confirming that the water effect is painted and not real."
0248-7,B
0251-0,"The ball falls off the disc because the movement of the mechanical figures underneath causes the disc to tilt significantly. This tilt angle, combined with the force of gravity acting on the ball, causes it to roll over the edge."
0251-1,"The ball falls off because it rolled very close to the edge, and the corrective tilt initiated by the mechanical figures—potentially due to an overcorrection, coordination failure among the figures, or a system error—pushed the ball over the edge instead of redirecting it back towards the center of the disc."
0251-2,"**No.**

The ball fell off because the disc tilted significantly due to the movement of the mechanical figures underneath. This tilting action, which is part of the artwork's intended mechanism, caused the ball to roll towards the edge and fall off due to gravity. There is no indication in the video that it was thrown immediately before falling."
0251-3,"**Yes**, the disc tilted due to the movement of the figures underneath. This tilt created an inclined plane, and the force of gravity caused the ball to roll down this incline and off the edge."
0251-7,D
0256-0,"**14 Bounces**

**Explanation:** The ping-pong ball bounces 12 times on the individual stair treads and then 2 more times on the flat landing at the bottom before going into the glass."

0259-0,"**Answer:** Left hand.
**Explanation:** The man removes his hat with his left hand and continues to hold it in that hand while attempting the second putt. He then throws the hat backwards using his left hand in frustration after missing the second shot."
0259-1,"**Answer:** Left hand.
**Explanation:** At the 0:05-0:06 mark in the video, the man clearly reaches up with his left hand, removes the hat from his head, and brings it down."
0259-2,"No, the man does not throw his hat away at any point in the video clip. His hat remains on his head throughout the entire sequence after he misses both putts."
0259-3,"No, the man did not throw his hat. He used his right hand to throw a tiny golf club in frustration after missing a shot with it, while his hat remained on his head."
0259-7,D
0266-0,"**Right Thumb.**

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows the yellow rubber band placed around the index finger and thumb of the person's right hand at the start, and it remains fully looped around the right thumb throughout the manipulations shown."
0266-1,"**Right thumb.**

**Explanation:** The video shows the person manipulating the yellow rubber band, twisting and looping it until it ends up completely wrapped around their right thumb."
0266-2,"**No**, the rubber band is only hooked over the tip of the left thumb during the trick, not fully looped around its entire circumference or base."
0266-3,"**Answer:** The state changes; the yellow rubber band is fully looped around the right thumb during the middle part of the trick's execution (approx. 0:02-0:16), but not in the initial or final positions shown in the video."
0266-7,A
0267-0,"The first person in the video is posing for a forced perspective shot on a sports court, creating an optical illusion where he appears to be hanging from a white line painted on the ground."
0267-1,"The person is **posing for a forced perspective photo, appearing to hang from the line.**

**Explanation:** The image uses an overhead camera angle and careful positioning of the person lying on the ground to create the optical illusion that they are hanging vertically from the white line painted on the court."
0267-2,"Yes, the person is creating an illusion by lying flat on the basketball court. The photo is taken from directly overhead, which uses forced perspective to make it appear as though they are hanging vertically from the white line. Their shadow being directly beneath them further indicates they are lying on the ground under a high light source."
0267-3,"Yes, the person in the video is jumping.

**Explanation:** The image captures the person mid-jump, using a high camera angle and specific timing to create the optical illusion of hanging from the white court line. The shadow beneath him confirms he is airborne off the ground."
0267-7,C
0273-0,"**Answer:** White
**Explanation:** When the boy finishes solving the Rubik's Cube and briefly holds it up (around 0:08-0:09), the face pointing directly upwards is clearly White."
0273-1,"**Color:** Yellow
*   **Explanation:** When the boy finishes solving the cube and holds it up around the 0:08-0:10 mark, the face oriented towards the top is visibly solid yellow."
0273-2,"**No.** The video shows that when the boy solves the Rubik's Cube and holds it up (around 0:09), the top face is yellow."
0273-3,"No, the top face of the solved Rubik's Cube is white."

0274-0,"**Answer:** 6 people.
**Explanation:** There is one central dancer and five other dancers surrounding them in the dance studio, making a total of six individuals visible in the video."
0274-1,"**6 individuals:** There is one central dancer in the front, and five other dancers are visible performing the choreography with him in the background."
0274-2,"**No**, there are only **five** people visible in the video. The group consistently shows one main dancer in the front and four background dancers throughout the clip."
0274-3,"No, there are five people visible in the video.

Explanation: Careful counting of each person dancing in the studio throughout the clip consistently shows five individuals (one main dancer in front, four backup dancers)."
0274-7,D
0276-0,"Yes, video editing effects were used, although the core visual illusion is practical.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Audio Editing:** Non-diegetic sound effects (like ""boing,"" ""eh?"", ""gasp"") are clearly added in post-production to enhance the viewing experience and emphasize the illusion and reveal.
2.  **Presentation Editing:** While not visual effects like CGI, editing ensures the crucial camera angle for the forced perspective is maintained consistently during the illusion sequence. It also controls the pacing and ensures continuity (no jump cuts during key interactions like the pencil pass), which helps sell the practical effect as seamless and believable."
0276-1,"The illusion of the pen passing under the cube is created using these techniques:

1.  **Cut-out and Folded Paper:** The ""cube"" isn't just drawn flat. A section of the paper with the cube's front/side faces is cut out and folded upwards, perpendicular to the main sheet.
2.  **Physical Gap:** This folding creates a real physical space *behind* the upright paper section. The pen passes through this actual gap, not under a drawing.
3.  **Anamorphic Perspective & Specific Camera Angle:** The cube is drawn distorted (anamorphic) so that when viewed from a specific, fixed camera angle, the folded paper section and the flat paper behind it align perfectly, making the drawing appear as a correctly proportioned 3D cube resting on the surface.
4.  **Drawn Shadow:** A shadow is drawn on the flat part of the paper beneath the upright section, reinforcing the illusion that the cube is a solid object casting a shadow and creating the expectation of space underneath it."
0276-2,"**No**, the illusion does not rely on video editing effects like masking.

**Explanation:** The effect is achieved by physically cutting out a section of the paper where the front edge of the drawn cube is located. The pencil then passes through this actual hole in the paper, creating the illusion that it is going underneath the 3D drawing when viewed from the specific camera angle. The end of the video reveals this cutout when the paper is lifted."
0276-3,"**Yes**, the illusion is created solely through skillful drawing and perspective without any video editing.

**Explanation:** The effect is achieved by drawing the cube using anamorphic perspective across a piece of paper that has been strategically cut and folded. Part of the drawing is on the flat surface (including the shadow), and the main vertical faces of the ""cube"" are drawn on a section of the paper that is folded upwards. When viewed from the specific angle of the camera, the drawing aligns perfectly to create a convincing 3D illusion. The final moments of the video, where the paper is lifted, reveal this physical construction."
0276-7,B
0278-0,"The writing on the paper is **black and red**.

**Explanation:** The initial problem statement (""Factor the polynomial. 3x³ + x² - 15x - 5"") is written in black, while the steps taken to factor the polynomial and the final answer are written using a red marker."
0278-1,"The text written on the paper is **Orange and Black**.

**Explanation:** The initial problem statement (""Factor the polynomial. 3x³ + x² - 15x - 5"") is written in black, while the subsequent steps demonstrating the factorization process are written using an orange marker."
0278-2,"**Yes**, the writing added to the paper during the explanation of the factoring steps is orange, as it is being written with an orange marker."
0278-3,"Yes, the writing showing the factorization steps on the paper is red."
0278-7,C
0288-0,"The large Chinese cleaver (also described as a heavy, rectangular knife or butcher's cleaver) was not easy to use.

**Explanation:** The woman participant visibly struggled when attempting to slice both the folded cloth and the piece of pork belly with this knife. She required two hands and considerable effort, yet still couldn't make clean or easy cuts, highlighting the difficulty she experienced compared to the man demonstrating."
0288-1,"Based on the video, the **large cleaver** is difficult to use, particularly when the woman attempts to slice through the **striped cloth/towel** and the **piece of fatty meat/pork belly**. She struggles significantly with both tasks, requiring two hands and considerable effort without achieving a clean cut, demonstrating the difficulty in handling the knife for those specific materials."
0288-2,"Yes, the knife implied to be difficult or less effective for the task is the smaller one with the dark handle, used by the woman towards the end of the video (around 0:53-0:58).

**Explanation:** The man demonstrates high proficiency and ease using his large cleaver. When the woman attempts to slice the pork fat with the smaller knife (which has a dark handle), the man immediately states, ""We have a problem,"" indicating her attempt with that specific knife was not successful or easy compared to the results expected or achieved with his cleaver."
0288-3,"**No, the lighter silver steel knife is not shown to be difficult to use.**

**Explanation:** The video shows the man using the silver knife effectively at the beginning. The only instance where difficulty is clearly demonstrated is near the end (0:55-0:58), when the woman struggles to slice the pork belly using the **larger, darker cleaver**, even with two hands, prompting the man to say, ""We have a problem."""
0288-7,C
0291-0,"**Answer:**

The rotational movement of the metal rod is primarily caused by **Ion Wind (Corona Wind)**.

**Explanation:**

The high voltage from the device ionizes the air molecules around the sharp tips of the metal rod. These newly formed ions are then strongly repelled by the rod (which has the same polarity), creating a stream of moving ions that collide with neutral air molecules. This generates a net flow of air, or ""wind,"" pushing away from the tips. Because the tips are slightly angled or the discharge is inherently asymmetrical, this ""wind"" exerts a tangential force (thrust) on the rod, creating a torque that causes it to spin."
0291-1,"**Initiation:** The rotation was initiated manually when the person used the white strip to push or tap the metal rod (visible around 0:03-0:04 in the video), giving it an initial spin.

**Continuation:** The rotation is sustained by the **ion wind** effect (also known as electric wind or corona wind). The high voltage from the Tesla coil concentrates at the sharp tips of the rotating rod, ionizing the surrounding air molecules. These ions are then strongly repelled by the rod, creating a stream of moving air (wind). The reaction force from expelling these ions pushes back on the rod tips, providing a continuous torque that keeps it spinning, much like a tiny pinwheel or Franklin's wheel."
0291-2,"**No**, the rotation started when the electrical arc from the central needle jumped to the metal rod, causing it to spin due to the electrical interaction, not because a human plucked it."
0291-3,"**Answer:**

No, the rotational movement of the metal rod is not caused solely by the interaction between the electric field and the metal rod. The rotation is primarily caused by the ""electric wind"" or ""ion wind"" effect. The high voltage from the device ionizes air molecules at the sharp tips of the rotating metal piece. These ions are then repelled by the electric field, creating a thrust (like tiny jets) that pushes the spinner around due to Newton's Third Law (action-reaction). While the electric field is essential to create the ionization, the direct mechanical force causing the rotation comes from the expelled ionized air."

0292-0,"**Answer:** 0

**Explanation:** Throughout the video frames and in the final long-exposure photograph, there are no other vehicles clearly visible traveling in the same direction *behind* the bus further down the road."
0292-1,"**Answer:** 0

**Explanation:** The real-time video footage shows the bus passing and moving away, but no other vehicles are clearly visible traveling behind the bus in the same direction during that sequence. A red car passes, but it is going in the opposite direction."
0292-2,"**Yes**, after the bus passes the camera's position, only one red car is clearly seen driving past in the same direction."
0292-3,"**Yes**, the long exposure photo shows two distinct sets of white/yellow light trails (consistent with headlights) following the path behind the bus's red and blue trails, indicating two vehicles were following it."
0292-7,D
0295-0,"**Answer:** One method.

**Explanation:** The person only used one method: attempting to pour the contents from the large yellow bag into the yellow squeeze bottle. The first attempt failed because the cap was still on the bottle, not because a different method was tried. They then used the same pouring method successfully after the cap was removed."
0295-1,"**Two techniques** were attempted.

**Explanation:**
1.  The person first tried pouring the yellow substance from the bag into the bottle through the attached nozzle.
2.  After the nozzle was removed, they attempted a second technique: pouring directly into the wider opening of the bottle."
0295-2,"**No.**

**Explanation:** The person used only one method: tilting the yellow bag to pour the contents out of its opening. They initially tried to pour while the bottle cap was still on, paused while the cap was removed, and then resumed pouring using the exact same technique."
0295-3,"**No**, the person only used one method: pouring the contents directly from the large yellow bag into the yellow squeeze bottle. The first attempt failed because the bottle cap was still on. After the cap was removed, they successfully used the same pouring method."

0296-0,"The man doesn't catch the blue pants on his first attempt because they shrink due to a visual effect *before* his hand reaches the spot where the full-sized pants were hanging. The object he was reaching for unexpectedly transformed into tiny pants, causing him to miss."
0296-1,"The man missed catching the large blue pants because it was a planned visual effect or editing trick for a comedic gag. The large pants were intentionally removed (likely digitally or via a practical effect) just as he reached for them, and replaced with the tiny pants to create the joke that they had ""shrunk in the wash."" He wasn't meant to actually catch the large pants; the ""miss"" was part of the setup for the reveal."
0296-2,"**Answer:** No.

**Explanation:** The man does not miss grabbing the blue pants on his first (and only) attempt shown in the video. He successfully takes them off the clothesline. The visual trick is that the pants he grabs are unexpectedly miniature (""shrunk in the wash""), not that a visual illusion prevented him from grabbing the normal-sized ones initially hanging there."
0296-3,"**Yes, the reason the man doesn't ""catch"" the blue pants is that they appear to be a prop, possibly a flat cutout or digitally added element, rather than real clothing.**

**Explanation:** The blue item hangs very rigidly and flatly, unlike real fabric pants. When the man reaches, it instantly disappears and is replaced by a tiny, equally rigid version in his hand. This immediate switch indicates a visual effect or editing trick, not a failed attempt to catch actual laundry. The item functions as a prop for the shrinking gag."

0303-0,"After landing the jump and rolling forward on the flat ground, the man stops cycling by jumping off the bike while it is still moving slowly, letting it fall over onto its side."
0303-1,He steps off the bike while it is still rolling slowly and lets it fall to the side.
0303-2,"No, the man does not stop cycling by jumping off his bike and crashing into a cushion. He performs an aerial trick, lands successfully on the large inflatable cushion while still on his bike, rides down the landing ramp, and then gets off his bike normally on the flat ground."
0303-3,"Yes, the man stops cycling by dismounting and walking away. After landing the aerial trick, he gets off his bike, leaves it on the ground, and walks away celebrating."
0303-7,C
0304-0,"**One layer.**

**Explanation:** The person initially starts writing the numbers ""128"" and the top part of the square root symbol only on the top visible layer of paper before the pen moves below the cut line to write on the second layer underneath."
0304-1,"The person starts writing on **one sheet** of paper.

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows the hand writing the equation ""128√e980"" continuously on a single surface above a horizontal line before the paper is manipulated to reveal the message underneath."
0304-2,"**Yes**, the person initially writes across a line that separates two paper surfaces. The pen marks both the top surface and the bottom surface simultaneously along this line. Removing the top surface reveals the message ""I Love you"" formed by the parts of the characters written on the bottom surface."
0304-3,"No, the person does not initially write on just one layer of paper. The writing starts simultaneously on two layers: the top, cut piece of paper and the bottom, whole piece of paper underneath it, crossing the cut line from the very first number drawn."

0313-0,"**9 compartments.**

**Explanation:** At the end of the video, all 9 of the white cube compartments contain products arranged as a retail display. The bottom row contains storage bins, not the products being displayed for sale."
0313-1,"**Answer:** 8
*   **Explanation:** By the end of the video, the person has placed products in 8 out of the 9 sections of the shelf. Only the top left section remains empty."
0313-2,"**Yes.** At the end of the video, the final display shows products placed within all 9 visible compartments of the 3x3 shelf grid."
0313-3,"**Answer:** No, the products occupy 9 compartments.

**Explanation:** At the end of the video, the products are displayed in the white shelving unit which has a 3x3 grid structure, totaling 9 compartments. All 9 of these compartments contain products."
0313-7,D
0319-0,"**Answer:** At the very end of the video, the ball is being picked up by the person's hand.

**Explanation:** After the ring is lifted, the ball continues in a straight line due to inertia, following the path labeled C. It rolls off the paper along this path and comes to a stop. The final action shown in the video is the person reaching down and picking up the ball from this stopping point."
0319-1,"**Answer:** The ball follows Path C.

**Explanation:** Due to inertia (Newton's First Law), once the constraining ring providing the inward (centripetal) force is removed at the gap, the ball continues to move in a straight line tangent to the circular path it was following at the moment of release. Path C represents this straight, tangential trajectory."
0319-2,"No, the ball does not end its motion *at* position C. After exiting the circular track, it continues in a straight line along path C due to inertia, and its motion is stopped further along this path by the person's hand.

Yes, at the very end of the video, the person picks up the ball and places it back inside the reassembled circular wooden piece."
0319-3,"**No**, the ball does not end up at position A.

**Explanation:** When the ball leaves the circular track, the inward force (centripetal force) provided by the track wall is removed. According to Newton's First Law of Motion (inertia), the ball continues to move in a straight line in the direction it was traveling at the moment it exited the track. This direction is tangent to the circular path at the exit point, which corresponds to path C in the diagram, not path A. The video clearly shows the ball following path C."

0320-0,The last person performs a running tucked backflip over the low horizontal bar.
0320-1,"The last person performs a **Back Tuck**.

**Explanation:** He jumps towards the low bar, rotates backward in the air, and tucks his knees towards his chest to clear the obstacle before landing."
0320-2,"**No**, the person does not stand on a pole. He performs a running backflip from the sandy ground, going over a horizontal yellow bar (which is supported by blue poles) and landing on the tire."

0321-0,"The group is performing a coordinated hand routine, likely for creating social media content.

*   **Explanation:** They stand in a circle, synchronizing specific hand gestures (fist, scissors, finger heart) filmed from a low angle, and a social media handle is visible on screen, suggesting the activity is staged for online sharing."
0321-1,"The group is performing a **coordinated hand game or choreography**, likely **to create a social media video**.

**Explanation:** The participants simultaneously perform a sequence of hand gestures (fist, scissors, fist, finger heart) in a circle, viewed from below against the sky. This synchronization, the specific gestures, the camera angle, and the visible Instagram handle strongly suggest they are creating content, possibly following a trend, which involves a planned sequence of hand movements."
0321-2,"**Yes.** The group performs synchronized hand gestures in a clear sequence (fist, peace sign, finger heart), indicating a planned choreography being filmed, likely for social media content as suggested by the overlaid handle."
0321-3,"Yes, the group uses hand gestures from rock, paper, scissors (""rock"" and ""scissors"") in a coordinated activity. However, the synchronized movements, the lack of the ""paper"" gesture, and the transition to finger hearts indicate it's a planned routine or social media trend rather than a standard competitive game."

0325-0,"The rider performs **7** significant jumps/flips off obstacles during the run shown in the video clip.

**Explanation:**

1.  **0:00:** Jump with a tailwhip/trick off the initial drop-in.
2.  **0:04:** Jump off a box jump with a trick (barspin/tailwhip).
3.  **0:10:** Jump off a ramp/berm feature with a trick.
4.  **0:15:** Jump with a 360 spin.
5.  **0:19:** Jump with a backflip barspin (Flip 1).
6.  **0:23:** Jump with a flair/whip (Flip 2).
7.  **0:27:** Jump with a cash roll (Flip 3).

This counts each instance the rider launches from a ramp or obstacle edge and performs an aerial maneuver before landing."
0325-1,"**Answer:** 8 Jumps, 5 Flips.

**Explanation:** The rider becomes airborne off a distinct ramp or obstacle 8 times. During these jumps, the rider performs 5 maneuvers that involve flipping rotations (cash roll barspin, backflip barspin, front flip, cash roll tailwhip, and flair)."
0325-2,"No, the rider did not flip and jump eight times while crossing the obstacles.

**Explanation:**

Based on the video, the rider performs tricks over 7 distinct major ramps/jumps. During these 7 jumps, the rider executes 4 maneuvers that involve a flip (including variations like cash rolls, backflips, and front flips). Therefore, the claim of eight flips and jumps is incorrect."
0325-3,"**No**, the rider performed significantly more than three jumps and executed multiple flips throughout the run across the various obstacles."

0334-0,"The scene that is NOT taken in real life is the **Pencil eraser clearing a path**.

**Explanation:** This image is a conceptual illustration, likely created using digital manipulation. It depicts a symbolic and physically impossible event (a giant pencil eraser clearing tangled roads), unlike the other scenes which use forced perspective photography with real objects and backgrounds."
0334-1,"The following scenes from the video do not depict real-life situations:

1.  A water bottle appearing to pour out a large waterfall.
2.  Scissor handles aligning perfectly to form the structure of a large bridge.
3.  A key appearing to fit perfectly into a large archway.
4.  A clothes hanger aligning to form the structure of a bridge.
5.  Highlighters appearing as large buildings along a canal.
6.  A person appearing to eat the sun from a bowl.
7.  A giant pencil eraser clearing a path through tangled roads.
8.  A whisk appearing to trap birds flying in the sky.

These scenes use techniques like forced perspective or digital manipulation to create optical illusions or conceptual images, rather than showing events as they would naturally occur."
0334-2,"**Yes, the image of the pencil erasing the road is digitally created.**

**Explanation:** The scene depicts a physically impossible scenario. A pencil eraser cannot erase actual roads, and the scale of the pencil relative to the landscape is unrealistic, indicating it was made using digital manipulation or illustration techniques."
0334-3,"**No, the scene is not real.** It depicts a giant pencil eraser clearing a path through tangled roads, which is physically impossible and clearly represents a concept through digital manipulation or illustration."

**Explanation:** There are four main drainage outlets built into the dam wall, which correspond to four channels on the spillway below them. Additionally, a separate overflow channel is constructed on the side."
0340-1,"**Answer:** 5

**Explanation:** The video shows the construction of four main drainage channels built into the primary spillway of the dam (clearly visible from 0:38 onwards, corresponding to the four openings mentioned at 0:17). Additionally, a separate overflow channel (泄洪通道) is dug into the side bank (shown from 0:51 onwards) to handle excess water. Therefore, there are a total of 4 + 1 = 5 drainage channels."
0340-2,"**Yes.**

The video clearly shows the construction process where the builder intentionally creates four distinct openings (孔洞 - kǒngdòng, holes/openings) in the dam wall (visible from 0:15 onwards, text confirms at 0:17). Later, four corresponding parallel channels are built on the downstream slope (spillway) to guide the water flow from these openings (visible from 0:36 onwards)."
0340-3,"Yes, there are five drainage channels shown in the video.

**Explanation:** The main structure of the dam features four parallel channels built into the spillway slope, corresponding to the four openings in the dam wall. Additionally, a separate, fifth overflow channel (spillway) is constructed on the side of the main dam structure."

0357-0,"The man in the white T-shirt seems surprised and amused. He pulls out a pickle, which is unexpected, and immediately bursts into laughter, suggesting he finds the absurdity of the situation humorous rather than being genuinely disappointed."
0357-1,"The man in the white T-shirt feels **shock and amusement**.

**Explanation:** His initial reaction, with wide eyes and an open mouth making an ""Ahhh!"" sound, clearly shows shock and surprise at finding a pickle. This quickly turns into amusement as he throws his head back and laughs heartily at the unexpected and silly outcome."
0357-2,"**No**, the man in the white T-shirt did not smile wryly or look disappointed. His reaction was one of initial surprise followed by genuine, hearty laughter when he pulled out the pickle/cucumber, indicating amusement rather than disappointment."
0357-3,"No, the man in the white T-shirt was not satisfied and happy with finding a pickle. His laughter seemed to stem from the humor and absurdity of finding a pickle, especially compared to others finding money or a phone, rather than genuine satisfaction with the item itself. A pickle is generally not considered a desirable prize in such a challenge."

0358-0,"The woman in white didn't fall onto the trampoline because the man asked her if she wanted to go, and she explicitly refused. Unlike the others whom he physically pushed, he respected her choice and did not force her."
0358-1,"The woman in white was not pushed onto the trampoline because when the man asked if she would go (""那你呢?"" - And you?), she explicitly refused (""不行不行"" - No, no / I can't, I can't). The man respected her refusal and decided to perform a trick himself instead."
0358-2,"Yes, the woman in white avoided falling on the trampoline because the man did not push her after she indicated she didn't want to go."
0358-3,"No, the woman in white did not jump off herself. She declined when the man asked if she wanted to go, saying ""不行不行"" (No, no). Consequently, the man decided to perform a backflip himself onto the trampoline instead of pushing her, leaving her safely seated on the platform."
0358-7,A
0368-0,"There are **10** scenarios shown in the video comparing adult and toddler behavior.

**Explanation:** The video presents pairs of clips. Each pair shows the man first acting as an adult in a specific situation, followed by him acting as a toddler in the same situation. Counting these distinct pairs reveals 10 different scenarios being compared."
0368-1,"There are **10** different scenarios demonstrated in the video.

**Explanation:** The video shows 10 distinct situations, each presented twice: once depicting an adult's typical behavior and once depicting a toddler's exaggerated or chaotic behavior in the same situation. These scenarios are: eating a snack, being asked to do something, napping, behavior when someone is showering, eating breakfast, watching a show, cleaning up, behavior after a baby falls asleep, giving something to someone, and playing with toys."
0368-2,"Yes, the man showed exactly ten scenarios comparing adult and toddler behavior.

**Explanation:** The video presents ten distinct pairs of actions, each contrasting how an adult performs a task versus how a toddler (portrayed by the same man) performs the same task. These scenarios include eating snacks, responding to requests, napping, reacting to someone showering, eating breakfast, watching TV, cleaning up, behaving after a baby falls asleep, giving an item, and playing with toys."
0368-3,"**No**, the video shows **ten** distinct scenarios comparing adult and toddler behavior in various everyday situations, not six."
0368-7,A
0370-0,"**Answer:** 9 girls are holding swords.
**Explanation:** At the beginning of the video, there is a formation of 9 girls in green uniforms arranged in three rows of three. The front row of 3 girls is clearly visible holding swords, and the identical uniforms, stances, and formation strongly indicate that the 6 girls in the two rows behind them are also holding swords."
0370-1,"**3**

At the start of the video (00:00), there are three girls clearly visible in the front row, each holding a sword."
0370-2,"**No.** At the beginning of the video, there are three girls in the front row holding swords."
0370-3,"Yes, only three girls are holding swords at the beginning of the video.

**Explanation:** At the 00:00 mark, the visual evidence clearly shows only the three performers in the front row holding swords. The performers behind them are holding flags."
0370-7,A
0372-0,"**Answer:** She completes an alley-oop dunk.

**Explanation:** At the end of the video, the boy throws the basketball up towards the hoop, and the girl catches it in mid-air while hanging from the rim and forces it down through the hoop. This specific type of play, involving a pass caught near the basket and immediately dunked, is called an alley-oop dunk."
0372-1,"At the conclusion of the video, the girl hangs from the basketball rim with both hands after being lifted by the boy, completing her part of a collaborative trick shot as the ball goes through the hoop."
0372-2,"Yes, the girl pretends to dunk the basketball by hanging on the basket at the end of the video. She is lifted to the rim by the boy, grabs it, and hangs, while the boy then throws the ball through the hoop to complete the illusion of a dunk."
0372-3,"**No**, the girl does not actually dunk the basketball.

**Explanation:** The boy lifts the girl onto his shoulders and she jumps towards the hoop. However, the boy picks up the basketball and throws it upwards into the hoop just as the girl reaches the rim. The girl does not handle the ball or force it downwards through the hoop; the basket is made by the boy's throw."
0372-7,C
0374-0,"Based on the video and the provided answers, here's what was used for the magic trick in the first part (the yellow balloon sequence):

A pre-inflated yellow balloon and a small piece of yellow rubber (likely a balloon neck piece) were used. The performer employed misdirection by placing the rubber piece in their mouth and pretending to blow onto the balloon's surface, creating the illusion of inflation without actually adding air."
0374-1,"The magic trick was executed using a pre-inflated yellow balloon. The performer created misdirection by placing a small, unrelated yellow object into their mouth. They then put the knot of the already inflated balloon to their lips and pretended to blow air into it, relying on acting and the prior misdirection to create the illusion of inflation."
0374-2,"**Yes**, the magic trick in the first part of the video involved using a balloon and an extra knot. The second performer didn't actually tie the yellow balloon; instead, they quickly placed a pre-made, separate knot-like piece onto the balloon's neck to create the illusion of tying it instantly."
0374-3,"**Answer:** Inserting.

**Explanation:** The performer pretends to swallow a small yellow object and then blows into the yellow balloon, creating the illusion that the object was magically inserted inside."
0374-7,B
0377-0,"The hand on the woman's shoulder belongs to **the man sitting on the bench next to her, who is wearing a black jacket and black cap.**"
0377-1,The hand belongs to **the man sitting next to the woman on the bench**. His left arm is visibly placed on her shoulder during the segment.
0377-2,"**No**, the hand on the woman's shoulder belongs to the man sitting **next to her** on the bench. His right arm is visibly positioned around her shoulder."
0377-3,"Yes, the hand on the woman's shoulder belongs to the man sitting next to her. His left arm is visibly placed around her shoulder in the video."
0377-7,B
0410-0,"After the sixth cotton candy ball (blue) was dissolved by the man in the grey shirt, it completely melted into the blue-tinted water. He reached into the bowl but found no hidden object inside, only pulling out water and dissolved remnants, reacting with surprise."
0410-1,"**Outcome:** Nothing is revealed inside the sixth cotton candy; it contained no hidden item.

**Explanation:** The sixth participant dissolves the blue cotton candy in the water, but unlike the previous turns, it dissolves completely without revealing any hidden object or prize, leaving only blue-colored water in the bowl."
0410-2,"**Yes.** After the sixth man dissolves the final blue cotton candy, he reaches into the bowl and pulls out empty hands, indicating he found nothing hidden inside."
0410-3,"**No**, a phone is not revealed after the sixth cotton candy dissolves.

**Explanation:** The video shows the sixth (blue) cotton candy dissolving completely into the blue liquid, revealing nothing inside the bowl. A phone was revealed earlier in the sequence, under the fifth (pink) cotton candy."
0410-7,D
0416-0,"The magician was surprised because the trick failed unexpectedly. He successfully made the egg vanish from his hands and clearly expected it to reappear under the cup. When the spectator lifted the cup and the egg wasn't there, it contradicted his expectation and the intended outcome, causing his genuine surprise and confusion."
0416-1,"The man performing the trick was taken aback because the egg, which he implied had magically transported under the cup after vanishing from his hands, was not actually there when the spectator lifted the cup. This could either be genuine surprise because the trick failed (perhaps due to a sleight of hand error) or acted surprise as part of the performance for misdirection."
0416-2,"Yes, the man was surprised. His surprise occurred first when the magician made the egg vanish from his hands, and then again when he lifted the cup and discovered the egg was not underneath it as the magic trick might have implied."
0416-3,"No, the man performing the trick (the magician) was not surprised. The surprise was shown by the spectator (the man on the left). The egg vanished from the magician's hand, not from under the cup initially, and it did not reappear in an unexpected place during the clip. The spectator was surprised first when the egg vanished from the magician's hand and again when it wasn't found under the cup."

0417-0,The soldier on the left is trying hard not to laugh because his colleague on the right accidentally completely covered his own head and upper body with the large flag during a formal ceremony. This unexpected mishap created an absurd and comical visual that contrasts sharply with the seriousness of the event.
0417-1,The soldier on the left is trying hard not to laugh because his colleague on the right has accidentally become completely engulfed by the large Olympic flag during the formal flag-raising ceremony. This unexpected and visually absurd mishap creates a comical contrast with the seriousness and precision expected in such a military event.
0417-2,"**No.**

**Explanation:** The potential humor comes from the unexpected and slightly absurd situation of his colleague getting tangled in the flag. He is trying not to laugh (if he is) *despite* the seriousness of the occasion, not *because* of it. The seriousness is the reason he must *suppress* any amusement, as laughing would be inappropriate during a formal ceremony. The trigger for the potential laughter is the mishap itself."
0417-3,"Yes, the soldier on the left is likely trying not to laugh because of the awkward and humorous flag mishap involving the soldier on the right. This incident disrupted the formal procedure, creating a comical ""problem"" during the ceremony, and the soldier's challenge is maintaining composure despite it."
0417-7,E
0420-0,"**No, we cannot tell if the cat won.**

**Explanation:** The cat clearly chooses a hand by tapping it, but the video ends before the person reveals whether the treat was in the chosen hand. Therefore, the outcome of the game is unknown."
0420-1,"The cat's success in the 'which hand' game is **unknown**.

**Reason:** The cat chose the left hand by tapping it, but the video ends immediately after the choice is made, before the person reveals whether that hand actually held the treat."
0420-2,"No, we cannot determine if the cat won the game.

**Explanation:** The video ends immediately after the cat taps one of the closed fists, but before the person opens their hand to reveal whether the object was inside the chosen fist. Therefore, the outcome of the game is not shown."
0420-3,"**No.**

**Explanation:** The video ends immediately after the cat taps one of the fists. It does not show the person opening their hands to reveal whether the chosen fist contained the treat or not. Therefore, we cannot determine if the cat chose the ""wrong"" hand or whether it won or lost the game."
0420-7,D
0427-0,"The man achieved the trick using a pane of glass, not a mirror. A hidden assistant, dressed identically, was positioned behind the glass. The assistant used a pre-cut watermelon and synchronized their movements with the man in front, who handled a whole watermelon. When the man mimicked cutting the whole watermelon, the assistant simultaneously revealed the pre-cut halves behind the glass, creating the illusion of an instant cut seen in a reflection."
0427-1,"**Method:** The man used a mirror and a pre-cut watermelon.

**Explanation:** He placed the bottom half of a pre-cut watermelon onto a mirror lying flat on the table. The mirror reflected this bottom half, creating the optical illusion of a complete, whole watermelon. He then pretended to cut it while actually just lifting the real top half away from the bottom half resting on the mirror."
0427-2,"No, video editing was not used. The illusion is a practical effect created using a mirror placed horizontally on the table, which reflects the top half of the watermelon as the man lifts it, making it appear as though a whole watermelon is being removed from the bottom half."
0427-3,"Yes, the trick was achieved by hollowing out the bottom half of the watermelon rind and placing a separate, peeled watermelon piece inside it. Lifting the top rind half then reveals the hidden peeled fruit, creating the illusion."
0427-7,A
0430-0,"**Answer:**

The damage is caused by the **hand-crank device delivering an extreme overvoltage/power surge** to the phone.

**Explanation:**

The blue hand-crank generator, when cranked rapidly, produces electrical power far exceeding the phone's charging limits. This overload causes catastrophic failure within the phone's circuitry and likely the battery, leading to the observed smoke/vapor and screen shattering. While the charging percentages shown are unrealistic and suggest a staged effect (especially with the ""FAKE"" reveal later), the fundamental trigger for the destruction is the excessive power forced into the phone by the external device."
0430-1,"The phone appeared damaged due to a **staged effect using a prop**.

**Explanation:** The video shows a hand-crank device seemingly overloading the phone, causing the screen to frost over and shatter. However, the later part of the video reveals the person picking up the ""damaged"" phone and showing it's just a pre-broken screen protector or prop placed on top of an intact phone (with a ""FAKE"" sticker visible). The frost and rapid charging percentage were likely visual effects added for the skit."
0430-2,"Yes, the phone damage was faked using a prop overlay. The video later demonstrates this technique on a second phone (an iPhone), where a pre-shattered layer is clearly peeled off, revealing an undamaged screen underneath and a ""FAKE"" sticker on the prop itself."
0430-3,"**Answer:**

No, the phone did not get damaged because it was overcharged with a hand-crank charger. The video uses special effects to show unrealistic charging speeds and dramatic screen shattering. The second part of the video confirms the effect is fake by revealing a prop screen with a ""FAKE"" sticker underneath, showing the actual phone screen was unharmed. Hand-crank chargers produce too little power to cause such rapid charging or damage."

0432-0,The last few targets are the empty shell casings ejected from the shotgun after each shot. The man catches or picks up the ejected casing and throws it into the air himself to shoot it.
0432-1,"**Answer:** The last few targets in the video are spent shotgun shell casings/hulls.

**Explanation:** After shooting the initial clay target, the man catches the ejected spent shell casing, throws it into the air, and shoots it. He repeats this action multiple times in rapid succession for the final shots shown."
0432-2,"Yes, the objects thrown by the man are the spent shotgun shell casings.

**Explanation:** After each shot is fired from the shotgun, an empty shell casing is automatically ejected. The objects the man throws at the end of the sequence are identical in appearance to these ejected casings."
0432-3,"**No.** The last targets (black clay pigeons) were launched rapidly and consistently in quick succession, which is characteristic of an automatic trap machine located elsewhere on the range, not the woman standing next to the shooter who is holding a manual thrower."
0432-7,B
0435-0,"Based on the video:

1.  **The first swing (approx. 0:02):** An upward diagonal drawing cut (*nukitsuke*) severs the topmost straw bundle as the man rises.
2.  **The second swing (approx. 0:06):** A downward diagonal cut (*kesa-giri*) severs the next bundle down.
3.  **The third swing (approx. 0:07):** A horizontal cut (*yoko-giri*) severs the third bundle down.
4.  **The fourth swing (approx. 0:08):** An upward diagonal cut (*kiriage*) severs the fourth bundle down."
0435-1,"All four swings successfully hit the straw mat target:

1.  The first upward diagonal swing at ~0:02.
2.  The second downward diagonal swing at ~0:06.
3.  The third downward diagonal swing at ~0:07.
4.  The fourth horizontal swing at ~0:08.

**Explanation:** Each of these swings visibly severs a section of the straw mat, causing it to fall off the stand."
0435-2,"**Yes**, the man's first sword swing hit the target. The video clearly shows the sword slicing through the topmost bundle of straw mats at the 0:02 mark, sending pieces of straw flying."
0435-3,"**No**, the man did not cut through *each* section of the straw mat target. While every swing shown successfully cut through *a* section, the bottom-most section remained uncut on the stand at the end of the sequence."
0435-7,C
0439-0,"The man lights **multiple small candles bundled together**.

**Explanation:** The video shows a blue object with numerous wicks on top. When lit, many individual flames appear, indicating that the object consists of multiple small candles grouped closely together, forming a bundle or cluster."
0439-1,The man ignites a cluster of blue-tipped matches that are standing upright in a holder.
0439-2,"Yes, the video shows a bundle of thin candles that are already lit and burning. The man is preparing to cover the lit candles with a glass vase as part of an experiment."
0439-3,"Yes, the object burning at the start of the video has multiple points of flame on top and strongly resembles a stack or bundle of matches stuck upright in a base."
0439-7,B
0441-0,"**Answer:**

Both the left and right legs execute a rapid, high-cadence running motion characterized by an exaggerated high knee drive where the thighs lift significantly high, combined with quick foot strikes and a relatively short stride length. This alternating action creates a powerful, somewhat choppy appearance."
0441-1,"Based on the video and the provided observations, the condition of the man's legs during running is:

Muscular, defined, and functional, appearing uninjured and actively engaged, though proportionally less massive than his upper body."
0441-2,"**He is actually running forward.**

**Explanation:** While the initial close-up shot makes his forward progress look minimal, the second clip, filmed from a wider angle (""What they see""), clearly shows him running and covering distance across the paved area relative to the background and the person filming."
0441-3,"**No.**

**Explanation:** The second part of the video (""What they see"") shows his actual running style. While he does lean forward, creating a forward thrust, his knee lifts are moderate rather than high. The first clip exaggerates these movements for comedic effect, contrasting with his more typical running form shown later."
0441-7,C
0452-0,"**Left Leg:** Agile and Quick.
*   *Explanation:* The left leg performs rapid, intricate footwork close to the ground.

**Right Leg:** Dynamic and Propulsive.
*   *Explanation:* The right leg is often used for hops, pushes, and driving the body's momentum."
0452-1,"**Left Leg:** Visually normal, but contextually implied by the meme to be Messi's legendary left leg.
**Right Leg:** Visually normal, but contextually implied by the meme to be Ronaldo's legendary right leg."
0452-2,"**No, the dancer's left leg is not disabled.**

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows the dancer performing complex and athletic breakdancing moves that require significant strength, coordination, and full function in both legs. The text overlay is a meme humorously suggesting the dancer has the legendary skills of Messi's left leg and Ronaldo's right leg, not indicating any actual physical disability."
0452-3,"Yes, the dancer's left leg predominantly executes quick, intricate, and agile movements close to the ground, while the right leg is often used for wider steps, pushes, and providing a stable, grounded base, which aligns with the concept of power or strength in this context."
0452-7,D
0456-0,"The man used a total of **7 nails** in the experiment.

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows the man placing 4 nails into the left mug and 3 nails into the right mug at the beginning (0:01-0:04). These same 7 nails are shown again after being cleaned at the end of the experiment (0:32-0:45)."
0456-1,"**Answer:** 6
**Explanation:** The man places three rusty nails into one mug and three rusty nails into the second mug at the beginning of the experiment. He then shows these same six nails after they have been cleaned by the liquids."
0456-2,"Yes, the man used six railroad spikes in total for the experiment. He placed three spikes into the left mug, which he filled with Monster energy drink, and three spikes into the right mug, which he filled with white vinegar. This is clearly visible at the beginning when he puts the spikes into the mugs and confirmed at the end when he pours them out and displays the results for three spikes from each liquid."
0456-3,"No, the man did not use 14 nails. He used a total of 6 large nails (railroad spikes), placing 3 in each mug, as clearly shown in the video when he adds them (0:02-0:03) and when they are removed (0:29-0:32)."
0456-7,D
0463-0,"The counter starts counting from the **first throw** shown after the ""BASKET COUNTER"" graphic appears on screen (around the 0:08 mark). This first attempt results in a miss, which is recorded by the first circle being marked with a red 'X'."
0463-1,"The counter begins counting from the **first throw** attempt made after the ""BASKET COUNTER"" graphic with five empty circles appears on screen (around the 0:07 mark). This first throw results in a miss, marked by the first red 'X' appearing on the leftmost circle of the counter."
0463-2,"**No, the counter starts counting from the very first throw.** The video shows the counter marking the first throw as a miss (red X) before the man takes his second shot."
0463-3,"**No**, the counter starts from the very first attempt shown in the sequence. It marks both misses (with an X) and successful baskets (with a checkmark) chronologically, beginning with the first throw, which was a miss."
0463-7,D
0466-0,"**Answer:** 7

**Explanation:** The video displays a total of 7 distinct images after the initial text overlay. Each of these images utilizes clever perspective (like forced perspective) or precise timing (like aligning objects with the sun or contrails) to create an optical illusion or a ""frozen moment"" effect."
0466-1,"**Answer:** 6

**Explanation:** The video contains 6 images that utilize optical illusions, primarily through forced perspective, pareidolia, or fortunate timing/alignment to create misleading or interesting visual effects."
0466-2,"Yes, the video contains 6 images that are related to optical illusions.

**Explanation:** The images utilize techniques such as forced perspective to manipulate the perception of size and distance (like the giant seagull or the ant lifting a twig), perfect timing and alignment to create coincidental effects (like the plane giving the sun ""ears"" or the contrail from the Statue of Liberty's torch), and pareidolia (like the bird murmuration forming a shape). These methods create visual effects that trick or play with the viewer's perception, which is characteristic of optical illusions."
0466-3,"**No**, the video shows 7 images, all of which are optical illusions created through techniques like forced perspective, alignment, or capturing natural phenomena that trick the eye."
0466-7,D
0468-0,"Based on the video clips:

The **second person** shown in the video (starting around 0:09), who is wearing **black socks** and walking down the **beige/cream carpeted stairs**, successfully walked down the stairs. They completed the descent without falling, unlike the first person (wearing polka-dot socks on grey stairs) who stumbled."
0468-1,"Based on the video, the **second person shown (wearing black socks on the beige/lighter-colored carpet)** was able to walk down the stairs successfully.

**Explanation:** The video first shows a person with polka dot socks on grey stairs attempting the challenge and falling. It then cuts to a second person with black socks on lighter stairs who carefully navigates the visually distorted steps and reaches the bottom without falling."
0468-2,"The outcome for the second person is **unknown/inconclusive**.

**Explanation:** The video clip featuring the second person ends while they are still descending the stairs. Although they successfully navigated several steps without falling during the visible portion, we cannot see if they reached the bottom successfully."
0468-3,"**No**, the first person did not successfully walk down the stairs. They are shown stumbling and losing their balance just before the video clip cuts off abruptly, strongly indicating they fell or could not continue the descent."

0512-1,"**Answer:** 3 pots
**Explanation:** At the beginning of the video, the ping-pong ball rolls off the initial track and bounces sequentially off the bottoms of three upside-down black pots before continuing on its path."
0512-2,"No, the ping-pong ball did not hit seven pots at the beginning of the video. It hit the bottom of four different pots sequentially after rolling down the initial metal track."
0512-3,"**No**, the ping-pong ball did not hit only two pots. It clearly bounces off the inverted bottoms of four separate pots in sequence at the beginning of the video."
0512-7,C
0520-0,"Based on the video:

The letters **I**, **V**, and **W** require the minimum number of people, which is one person each."
0520-1,"The letters that require the fewest people to form are **I, V, and W**.

**Explanation:** Observing the video, the letters I, V, and W are each formed by a single person, while all other letters require two or three people."
0520-2,"Yes, the letters 'I,' 'V,' and 'W' each require only one person to form in the video.

**Explanation:**
The video shows:
*   **'I'** being formed by one person standing straight.
*   **'V'** being formed by one person sitting and raising their legs into a V-shape.
*   **'W'** being formed by one person lying on their back and arranging their arms and legs into a W-shape."
0520-3,"**Answer:** No, the letter 'I' is not the only one formed by the minimum number of people.

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows a person running into the water and wading on two legs to help the individual in the wheelchair."
0525-1,"**Two legs.**

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows a person running/wading through the water on two legs to help the individual in the wheelchair."
0525-2,"**No, the person helping has two legs.** Both legs are visible as they run into the water and assist the person in the wheelchair."
0525-3,"**Yes, it is true.** The video shows the person assisting running through the floodwater on two legs to reach and help the individual in the wheelchair."
0525-7,B
0526-0,"The man is holding **two** lighters.

**Explanation:** He holds a standard orange disposable lighter in one hand and a blue pen-shaped torch lighter in the other hand. Both objects produce a flame."
0526-1,The man is holding **two** lighters. He holds a standard orange lighter in one hand and uses it to light a blue torch lighter held in the other hand.
0526-2,"**No**, the man is holding one standard orange lighter in his left hand and an object that looks like a pen in his right hand. He uses the standard lighter to ignite the tip of the pen, which then functions as a torch lighter."
0526-3,"No, the man is holding two lighters in the second video clip (00:10-00:16). He holds a standard orange lighter in one hand and uses it to light a blue pen-shaped lighter/torch held in the other hand."
0526-7,B
0530-0,"**Answer:** The man in blue kicked the stationary soccer ball placed on the ground.

**Explanation:** In the fifth scene (0:09-0:11), there are three soccer balls. One man kneels holding two balls, while the third ball rests stationary on the grass in front of him. The man in blue runs up and kicks this stationary ball on the ground towards the goal."
0530-1,The man in blue kicked the soccer ball placed on the ground to his left. This was the only ball not being held by the kneeling man.
0530-2,"**Answer:** No
**Explanation:** In the scene starting around 0:10, the man in the blue shirt kicks the leftmost of the three soccer balls, not the middle one."
0530-3,"**No**, the man in blue kicked the bottom soccer ball resting on the grass, causing the top ball (held by the kneeling man) to fall after its support was removed."
0530-7,B
0539-0,"**Answer:** 5 people.
**Explanation:** There is a group of four pedestrians on the sidewalk (around 0:07) and one woman standing outside a mail truck (around 0:59) who visibly react with fear or surprise to the masked person."
0539-1,"**5**

**Explanation:** There is a group of 4 pedestrians on the sidewalk who are clearly frightened and run away, and 1 postal worker standing at the door of her truck who is startled. (4 + 1 = 5)."
0539-2,"**No, that is not true.** The video shows a total of five people outside of cars reacting with fear or surprise (a group of four pedestrians and one person near a mail truck), not six."
0539-3,"**False.**

The video shows a group of four pedestrians reacting fearfully, and later, a mail carrier standing outside her truck also appears startled and scared. This makes a total of five people not in a car who are scared."
0539-7,C
0541-0,There are **12 teeth** shown in the drawing in the video. This is determined by counting the 6 teeth depicted on the upper jaw and the 6 teeth depicted on the lower jaw.
0541-1,"**12 teeth:** The drawing consistently shows 6 upper teeth and 6 lower teeth, making a total of 12 teeth visible throughout the video."
0541-2,"Yes, there are consistently 10 teeth visible (5 upper, 5 lower) in the drawing throughout the video. Dipping the bag in water creates an optical illusion making the black spots vanish temporarily due to refraction, but the outlines of all 10 teeth remain visible from start to finish."
0541-3,"**No**, the number of visible teeth does not decrease to none.

**Explanation:** While the black spots drawn on the teeth disappear when covered by water (due to light refraction and potentially how the drawing is layered inside the bag), the outlines of the teeth themselves remain visible throughout the video."
0541-7,D
0542-0,"The scene shown as a metaphor for time passage while the bread cooks is the **Person Relaxing Under Waterfall** (0:48-0:49).

**Explanation:** This brief cutaway shot occurs immediately after the hot coals are placed on the lid of the pan to bake the stromboli. It visually represents the cook taking a break and waiting for the baking process to complete, thus signifying the passage of that cooking time."
0542-1,"The wide shot of the waterfall and surrounding nature (0:49).

**Explanation:** This brief cutaway to the steady, natural flow of the waterfall, occurring right after the cooking setup is complete (coals placed on the lid), is a common cinematic technique used to indicate that a period of time is passing while an unseen process (the baking) takes place."
0542-2,"**Yes.**

The scene of the person sitting under the waterfall is placed directly between the moment the stromboli is put on the fire to cook and the moment it is taken off. This editing choice uses the calm, waiting scene to visually represent the passage of time required for the baking process."
0542-3,Yes. The waterfall scene is positioned in the video immediately after the coals are placed on the pan for baking and just before they are removed. This editing choice visually represents the passage of time while the stromboli cooks inside the covered pan over the fire.
0542-7,D
0548-0,"The second thing the man clips with the car window is a **cucumber**.

**Explanation:** In the video clip (around 0:08-0:09), the man first holds up a hotdog to the window, and immediately after, he holds up a cucumber and closes the window on it."
0548-1,"The second item the man clips with the car window is a **Cucumber**.

**Explanation:** At approximately 0:09 in the video, after clipping a hot dog, the man holds up a long, green, cylindrical vegetable that strongly resembles a cucumber and clips it with the car window."
0548-2,"Yes, the man clipped the cucumber with the car window after clipping the sausage. The video shows him first using a sausage (0:08) and then immediately after, a cucumber (0:09) with the closing car window."
0548-3,**No.** The second item the man clips to the car window is a cucumber; the carrot is the third item.
0548-7,B
0551-0,"**Answer:** Both switches are in the off position.
*   **Explanation:** In the scene where the woman is kneeling (around 0:12-0:17), the two rocker switches on the wall plate both have their top portions pressed in, which typically indicates the 'off' state for this type of switch."
0551-1,"The switch is a single, white, vertical light switch plate located on the wall to the right of the white door (which has a glass panel) and to the left of the tall brown cabinet. It is positioned roughly in the middle horizontally of the wall space between the door trim and the cabinet, and above the kneeling woman's head height."
0551-2,"**No, the switch remains in the same position throughout the scene where the woman is kneeling.** It is static in the background and does not change state."
0551-3,"**Yes.** Both switches visible on the wall plate are tilted downwards, indicating they are in the same position."
0551-7,B
0552-0,"**Answer:** 4
**Explanation:** There are four triangular pieces of toasted bread visible on the plate the person is holding."
0552-1,**4 slices:** There are four slices of toasted bread visible on the plate being held by the person in the kitchen scene.
0552-2,"Yes, the person is carrying a plate with three sandwiches, each made from a pair of sliced bread."
0552-3,"Yes, the person in the kitchen is carrying four slices of what appear to be toasted sandwiches or bread on the plate."
0552-7,A
0561-0,"**Answer:** 7
*   **Explanation:** The watch is visible on the man's left wrist in 7 out of the 8 time segments shown (2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years). It is not visible in the ""9 months"" segment because his long sleeve covers his wrist."
0561-1,"**Answer:** The man's watch appears in 7 out of the 8 time segments shown in the video.

**Explanation:** The watch is visible on his left wrist in the segments for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. It is not visible in the 9-month segment because his sleeve covers his wrist."
0561-2,"**No**, the man's watch appears **8 times** in the video. It is visible on his left wrist in each of the distinct time segments shown (2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year, and 2 years)."
0561-3,"No, the man's watch does not appear 10 times. It appears 8 times, once in each of the distinct time segments shown in the video (2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year, 2 years)."
0561-7,E
0566-0,"Based on the narration emphasizing the ""obvious"" effectiveness of using both products, the broken plant pot scene serves as a visual metaphor for the mess or residue that might be left after an initial cleaning attempt (like using only toilet paper). Sweeping the dirt illustrates an action that may not achieve complete cleanliness, thereby setting up the contrast and highlighting why the combined use of toilet paper and wipes provides a superior, ""obvious"" clean."
0566-1,"The purpose of showing the broken pot of plant being swept up is primarily as a **metaphor for incomplete cleaning**. It's part of a montage illustrating various types of messes, and the act of sweeping the dry dirt visually represents a cleaning method (analogous to using only dry toilet paper) that might remove the bulk of the mess but potentially leaves behind fine residue, thus setting up the need for a more thorough solution like the advertised wet wipes."
0566-2,"Yes, the scenes with the broken pot of plant symbolize the mess and the ineffective cleaning process of using rolled toilet paper.

**Explanation:**

The advertisement juxtaposes scenes representing difficult-to-clean messes (like the spilled soil from the broken pot being swept inefficiently) with the act of using only dry toilet paper. This visual metaphor suggests that dry paper alone is insufficient for achieving a thorough clean, much like the small brush struggles to completely remove the scattered soil. The subsequent introduction of wet wipes, followed by scenes representing cleanliness and effectiveness, reinforces the message that combining both products offers a superior solution."
0566-3,"Yes, the scenes with the broken pot plant serve as a visual metaphor within the ad. The act of cleaning up the spilled dirt symbolizes the thorough and effective cleaning job that Neve toilet paper and wipes accomplish, comparing personal cleanup to tidying a physical mess."
0566-7,B
0567-0,"The third person in the video, the woman preparing the healthy food, has **long, dark hair** (appearing black or very dark brown)."
0567-1,"**Black/Very Dark Brown:** The third individual shown in the video, a woman preparing food, has long hair that appears black or a very dark shade of brown under the lighting conditions."
0567-2,"Yes, the third person shown in the video is the woman with long black hair who appears after the two men and proceeds to make and distribute healthy food."
0567-3,"**No**, the third person shown in the video is a woman with long, dark hair. The man with blonde hair and dark roots appears first in the video."
0567-7,A
0571-0,The man is wearing a ring on the **ring finger of his right hand**.
0571-1,"The man is wearing a ring on his **right ring finger**.

**Explanation:** The ring is clearly and consistently visible on the fourth finger (the one next to the pinky) of his right hand throughout the video, including when he holds the illusions and rests his hand near his face."
0571-2,"**No**, the man is not wearing a ring on the middle finger of his left hand.

**Explanation:** Throughout the video, the man's left hand (the one on the right side of the screen as he holds the objects) is visible, showing tattoos on the fingers but no ring on the middle finger. A ring is clearly visible on the ring finger of his *right* hand."
0571-3,"**Yes.**

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows a ring on the ring finger (the fourth finger) of the man's right hand in multiple shots, particularly when he is holding the optical illusion objects between 0:00-0:02 and 0:29-0:49."
0571-7,A
0575-0,Error
0575-1,"The two things associated with the little girl's feet are **pink flip-flops** and a **smartphone**.

*   **Explanation:** The girl is visibly wearing a pair of pink flip-flops. When the man lifts her right foot, a black smartphone is revealed hidden underneath the flip-flop she was standing on."
0575-2,"**No**, the item on the girl's foot is a pink slipper. The phone was found lying on the ground *underneath* the slipper when the man lifted it. It was not a phone case shaped like a slipper being worn on her foot."
0575-3,Error
0575-7,A
0576-0,"The girl labeled ""GEN-Z"" (on the right) uses a belt. She adds a black belt over her grey sweater."
0576-1,"The person labelled ""GEN-Z"" is wearing a belt. They put it on over their grey sweater to cinch the waist before adding the blazer."
0576-2,"Yes, the GEN-Z girl is the one using a belt in the video. She adds a black belt over her grey sweater around the 0:07 mark."
0576-3,"**No**, the millennial girl is not the one using a belt. The video shows the girl labeled ""GEN-Z"" adding a belt over her grey sweater, while the ""millennial"" girl does not wear one."
0576-7,D
0578-0,"**7 people**

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows the two main characters (the man doing parkour and the Mr. Bean character), two construction workers on the rooftop (one operating the lift, one nearby), and at least three distinct background individuals in the final alley scene."
0578-1,"**8 individuals**

This includes the two men performing parkour, Mr. Bean, the two construction workers on the roof, and the three people seen in the background alleyway at the end."
0578-2,"Yes, there are 8 people visible in the video.

**Explanation:** The count includes the man performing parkour, the man in the suit (Johnny English/Mr. Bean), two construction workers on the roof during the jump, one construction worker operating the lift, and three additional people visible in the background during the final alley scene."
0578-3,"**Yes.**

The video shows two main characters, several distinct construction workers on rooftops and a lift, and multiple bystanders in the final alley scene. Summing the clearly identifiable individuals brings the count close to ten, and the crowded nature of the alley scene makes it highly probable that at least ten people appear in total across the different clips."
0578-7,B
0580-0,"**Answer:** The girl took **3 steps** running up the wall before reaching the top.

**Explanation:**
1. Her first step onto the wall is with her right foot.
2. Her second step onto the wall is with her left foot.
3. Her third and final step onto the wall is with her right foot, which she uses to push off and grab the ledge."
0580-1,"**Answer:** 5 steps.

**Explanation:** The girl takes five distinct steps on the surface of the warped wall before grabbing the top ledge."
0580-2,"**Yes, the girl ran four steps before she reached the top.**

*   **Explanation:** By carefully watching her feet make contact with the warped wall surface, you can count four distinct steps (right, left, right, left) before she jumps and grabs the top edge."
0580-3,"**No, the girl did not run five steps before she reached the top.**

She took six steps up the warped wall before grabbing the top edge."
0580-7,B
0588-0,"**Answer:** 4 drawers.

**Explanation:** The white table visible around the 0:08 mark, which has the globe on top, clearly shows two smaller drawers across the top row and two larger drawers below them, totaling four drawers."
0588-1,"**Answer:** 4

**Explanation:** The white dresser visible between 0:07 and 0:10 has two small drawers on the top row and two larger drawers below them, for a total of four drawers."
0588-2,"Yes, the white desk with the globe on top has five drawers. There are two smaller drawers across the top and three larger drawers stacked vertically below them."
0588-3,"**Yes**, the desk with the globe has four drawers.

*   **Explanation:** The video shows the white desk has two smaller drawers across the top and two larger drawers below them."
0588-7,B
0589-0,"No, the person did not eat all the chocolate in six hours.

While the video uses time markers showing the chocolate disappearing by the 6-hour mark, consuming such a large quantity (stated as 100 liters worth) in that timeframe is physically unrealistic. The video likely uses editing techniques like time-lapses or cuts, and the displayed duration is part of the performance rather than the actual time taken."
0589-1,"**No.** The video explicitly shows a timestamp of ""6 hours"" while a significant amount of chocolate is still left in the tank."
0589-2,"**No.** At the 6-hour mark shown in the video (around 0:06-0:09), the level of chocolate remaining in the tank is visibly well below the halfway point, indicating that significantly more than half had already been consumed."
0589-3,"**No.**

The video shows time markers up to ""6 hours"" during the chocolate eating segment. The ""12 hours"" timestamp appears at the end of the *second* challenge, which involved drinking coconut water with a fork."
0589-7,A
0590-0,"At the end of the video, the man in the black jacket screamed because the man in the red sweater placed a large toy spider directly on his forehead after he had fallen down the stairs."
0590-1,"The man in the black jacket screamed because the man in the red sweater placed a large (likely fake) spider directly on his forehead after he had fallen down the stairs. This was the final trap set for him, causing him to scream out of shock, surprise, and fear upon seeing it."
0590-2,"Yes, the man in the black jacket screamed because the man in the red shirt placed a toy spider on his face while he was lying on the floor at the bottom of the stairs after being chased."
0590-3,"**No**, the man in the black jacket screamed because the other man placed a large fake spider directly on his face while he was lying on the ground at the bottom of the stairs."

0595-0,"The boy (Michiel) scored with the large blue exercise ball, the soccer ball, and the tennis ball. The video shows him successfully getting each of these items into the pool, and the on-screen scoreboard confirms each successful attempt with a green checkmark next to the corresponding icon under his name."
0595-1,"The boy (Michiel) used the **Blue Ball, Soccer Ball, and Tennis Ball** to score.

*Explanation:* The video shows Michiel successfully getting the blue ball, then the soccer ball, and finally the tennis ball into the net next to the pool. Each successful shot is marked with a green checkmark above the corresponding ball icon under his name."
0595-2,"**Answer:** Yes.
**Explanation:** The video shows Michiel successfully scoring with the blue exercise ball (kicking it in), the soccer ball (heading it in), and the tennis ball (throwing it in). The on-screen scoreboard confirms his success with green checkmarks for all three attempts."
0595-3,"**No**, the boy did not score with a basketball, volleyball, or baseball.

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows the boy (Michiel) scoring goals by throwing or kicking a large blue exercise ball, a soccer ball, and a tennis ball into the net before falling into the pool. These are the items indicated by the icons next to his name, not the balls mentioned in the question."
0595-7,D
0597-0,"Based on the video, the person holding the camera is:

**Actively filming outdoors while running or jogging backwards, facing the subjects to follow their action. This requires physical capability, balance, and coordination.**"
0597-1,"The person operating the camera is an unseen individual running backwards in front of the actors.

**Explanation:** The video consistently shows the subjects running towards the camera's point of view, indicating the camera operator must be moving backward at a similar speed to keep them framed throughout the various skits."
0597-2,"**Answer:** No. The person holding the camera (the photographer) is wearing white sneakers, but their jacket appears to be beige or tan, not light gray."
0597-3,"**Answer:** No, it is not possible to determine if the person holding the camera is wearing a white t-shirt and black sneakers.

**Explanation:** The video is filmed from a first-person perspective, meaning the person holding the camera is not visible in the footage. While their shadow can sometimes be seen, it lacks the detail needed to confirm the specific items or colors of their clothing and shoes."
0597-7,B
0600-0,"**Buttocks / Rear End.**

**Explanation:** The video shows the boy losing his balance while attempting the trick. He bends forward at the waist, and the large orange ball, positioned behind him, rolls forward and strikes him squarely on his buttocks/rear end area."
0600-1,The orange ball made contact with the boy's **right foot** when he intentionally kicked it forward.
0600-2,**No:** The orange ball remains stationary on the ground throughout the video and does not hit the boy.
0600-3,"**No.** The boy kicks the orange ball forward, and it rolls away from him along the grass. It does not hit him on the back."
0600-7,E
0603-0,"Based on the video, the person who failed twice in a row (at 0:31 and 0:41) and lost their final heart-shaped pattern has the following characteristics:

*   Wears a Blue T-shirt and Blue Track Pants (with white stripes).
*   Is Barefoot.
*   Has Dark Hair and Facial Hair.
*   Performs Acrobatic Moves (like flips/tumbles) within a Blue Hoop.
*   Loses Blue Pixelated Hearts when failing.
*   Gets Splashed with Water from a blue balloon upon his final loss."

*   Wears a blue t-shirt.
*   Is barefoot.
*   Has short, dark hair, a beard, and a mustache.
*   Uses the blue hula hoop.
*   Is associated with the blue balloon and blue heart icons.
*   Fails on two consecutive attempts involving non-backflip acrobatic moves (around 0:29 and 0:39).
*   Gets splashed with water when his final blue balloon pops."
0603-2,"**Yes**, the person in the blue shirt and dark blue pants failed their stunt attempt at 0:31 and failed again on their next turn at 0:40, thus failing twice in a row relative to their own turns and losing their last two hearts."
0603-3,"**No.**

**Explanation:** The person wearing the red shirt with the white 'm' logo and standing in the pink hula hoop failed twice during the game (at 0:02 and 0:18), but these failures were not consecutive. The person who failed twice in a row was the player wearing the blue shirt and standing in the blue hula hoop (at 0:32 and 0:42), which resulted in them losing the game."
0603-7,C
0607-0,"At the end of the video, the man is falling from the ceiling.

*Explanation:* The device anchoring his right foot to the ceiling breaks loose, causing him to lose support and begin falling downwards as the video cuts off."
0607-1,"The man is actually right-side up on the floor, performing a handstand variation with his hands on the black objects. The video has been rotated 180 degrees to create the illusion that he is hanging from the ceiling."
0607-2,"**No.**

The man is hanging upside down from the actual ceiling using specialized gear attached to his feet. Evidence includes the basketball falling downwards towards the floor (away from him), the normal orientation of furniture on the floor below him, balloons floating upwards towards the ceiling he is attached to, and his eventual fall downwards when one foot detaches."
0607-3,"**No**, the man is hanging upside down from the ceiling. He is gripping devices attached to the ceiling with his hands, not standing on equipment with his feet."
0607-7,A
0609-0,A player is eliminated when the object falls off the edge of the table closest to them.
0609-1,"Based on the video, elimination is decided when the red object reaches the edge of the table closest to a player, causing that player to remove their hands from the table surface."
0609-2,"**Yes**, elimination is based on participants moving their hands prematurely while the girl is still holding and maneuvering the ball, trying to trick them into flinching."
0609-3,"Yes, the elimination is determined by who the ball stops closest to.

**Explanation:** The video shows players spinning the ball on the table. When the ball comes to rest, the person it is nearest to appears to be eliminated from that round, as indicated by the players' reactions and the subsequent reduction in participants."
0609-7,C
0610-0,"The woman threw the package out the window as a comedic exaggeration within the skit. It visually demonstrates the extreme convenience and hyper-speed service provided by the two men, fitting the video's theme of them instantly fulfilling her needs in an over-the-top manner. Throwing it acts as the quickest way to ""send"" it in this absurd scenario, initiating the task for the helpers who are immediately ready to catch and deliver it."
0610-1,"Based on the video's context where two men provide instant, exaggerated service, the best reason the woman tossed the package out the window is:

**To delegate the task of mailing the addressed package to her hyper-efficient helpers.** Tossing it out the window serves as a comically exaggerated and immediate way to hand off the task, fitting the video's theme of instant, over-the-top service provided by the men."
0610-2,"**No.** The video is playing in reverse. The actual event depicted is the men running towards the house and tossing the package into the window for the woman, likely representing a mail delivery."
0610-3,"**No, she was not trying to get rid of the package in the sense of discarding it.**

**Explanation:** The video shows her addressing the package first, indicating an intent to send it. Immediately after she throws it out the window, two men run to catch/retrieve it and run off, suggesting a coordinated and rapid handover rather than disposal."
0610-7,E
0612-0,"The artist divides the paper to create a direct, side-by-side comparison between the results achieved using $0 unconventional materials (like burnt matches, coffee, grass, food) and $300 professional colored pencils on the exact same drawing. This clearly structures the ""$0 vs $300"" challenge, allowing viewers to easily contrast the different techniques and the final visual outcome based on the cost and type of materials used."
0612-1,"The paper is divided into two sections to allow for a direct, side-by-side comparison.

**Explanation:** This division visually contrasts the results of coloring the same portrait using unconventional, free materials (labeled ""$0 Pencils,"" like burnt matches, coffee, grass) on the left side versus using expensive, professional colored pencils (labeled ""$300 Pencils"") on the right side. It highlights the differences in outcome, technique, and potentially the value proposition between zero-cost resourcefulness and high-cost art supplies."
0612-2,"**Yes**, the purpose of dividing the paper is to create a direct visual comparison between coloring the portrait using unconventional, everyday items (represented as ""$0 Pencils"" because they are essentially free or very low-cost substitutes) and coloring it using expensive, professional-grade colored pencils (labeled ""$300 Pencils""). This split format deliberately contrasts the results and techniques of using improvised materials versus high-cost, traditional art supplies side-by-side on the same subject."
0612-3,"Yes, the division is explicitly for comparing the results achieved using expensive, professional colored pencils ($300 Pencils) versus using unconventional, essentially free materials (represented metaphorically as ""$0 Pencils"").

**Explanation:** The ""$0 Pencils"" side does not use actual pencils but rather substitutes like burnt matches, coffee, crushed grass, fruit, and toothpaste to create colors and effects, directly contrasting these resourceful, no-cost methods with the standard, expensive art supplies used on the other side."
0612-7,D
0614-0,"Based on the video, the man's trembling hands at the beginning appear to be due to **nervousness or anxiety**, likely related to his planned interaction with the waitress (giving her a gift later). It's also highly possible this is **part of an acting performance for a staged scenario**, where the trembling is intentionally shown to portray nervousness before the gift-giving moment."
0614-1,"Based on the video, the man's hands tremble likely due to **nervousness, anxiety, or excitement** related to the social interaction with the waitress, especially considering he later gives her a gift. It's also possible this is **intentional acting** for the video's narrative."
0614-2,"Yes, the man is pretending to have trembling hands.

**Explanation:** His tremors are pronounced while he tries to pour his drink and eat, leading the waitress to help him. Immediately after she assists, his hands become perfectly steady, he interacts normally, retrieves a gift from his bag, and gives it to her as a reward. This sudden recovery and the reward structure indicate the trembling was an act, likely for a social experiment or video content testing kindness."
0614-3,"Based on the video and the provided explanations, the man's trembling hands are most likely due to a **combination of nervousness and excitement**.

**Explanation:** He appears both eager (excited) to give the waitress the gift and potentially anxious (nervous) about her reaction, the timing, and performing the gesture in a public restaurant setting. These emotions often occur together in situations involving social anticipation and vulnerability."
0614-7,B
0616-0,"**Answer:** The white ball reaches the finish line first.

**Explanation:** Although the blue and black balls start earlier, the white ball navigates the obstacles more effectively and enters the final narrow channel at the end of the track before the other two balls."
0616-1,"**Answer:** The white ball crosses the finish line first.

**Explanation:** Although the white ball started last, its path through the obstacle course was faster, allowing it to overtake the blue and black balls and reach the final narrow channel ahead of them."
0616-2,"Yes, the white ball is the first to reach the finish line. Although it starts last, it navigates the obstacles more efficiently and overtakes the other two balls to finish first."
0616-3,"No, the blue ball does not reach the finish line first.

**Explanation:** Although the blue ball starts slightly earlier, the white/yellow ball overtakes it during the race and reaches the finish line ahead of the blue ball."

0620-0,"**Answer:** The man is hanging upside down from the ceiling in what appears to be a living room or den.

**Explanation:** The video shows the man inverted, with his feet attached to the ceiling via specialized gear-like devices. He is clearly indoors in a furnished room, not standing on the floor."
0620-1,"Based on the visual evidence in the video, particularly how the man ""falls"" upwards and the balloons float ""downwards"" towards the apparent ceiling near the end, the video is inverted.

Therefore, the man's actual position is **standing or crouching right-side up on the floor.** The camera is upside down, making the floor appear to be the ceiling."
0620-2,"**No.**

The man is hanging upside down from the actual ceiling using specialized gear attached to his feet. Evidence includes the basketball falling downwards towards the floor (away from him), the normal orientation of furniture on the floor below him, balloons floating upwards towards the ceiling he is attached to, and his eventual fall downwards when one foot detaches."
0620-3,"**No**, the man is hanging upside down from the ceiling. He is gripping devices attached to the ceiling with his hands, not standing on equipment with his feet."
0620-7,B
0621-0,"For Mini Michiel, it's the **right foot**. He leans his right side against the wall, and his right foot is planted closer to the wall first to support the lean.

For Michiel, it's the **left foot**. He leans his left side against the wall, and his left foot is planted closer to the wall first to support the lean."
0621-1,"Based on the video and the provided observations:

*   **Mini Michiel:** Left foot
*   **Celine:** Right foot
*   **Bram:** Right foot
*   **Laura:** Right foot
*   **Michiel:** Left foot"
0621-2,**Yes.** All participants lean towards their left side simultaneously. The left foot is the foot on the side that is leaning towards the wall from the beginning of the action.
0621-3,"**Answer:** No.
**Explanation:** The person who successfully leans against the wall and whose feet are most clearly visible adjusting (Mini Michiel) appears to move their left foot back towards the wall slightly before their right foot."
0621-7,B
0625-0,"**Answer:** Horizontally left, towards the center.

**Brief Explanation:** The second ball appears on the right side of the central vertical track at approximately the 0:02 mark. Its initial displacement is clearly horizontal, moving from the right towards the left, which is also towards the center of the circular area."
0625-1,"**Answer:** Horizontally to the left.

**Explanation:** After the first ball moves down, the second ball appears on the right side of a newly revealed horizontal track and moves along that track towards the left."
0625-2,"**No**, the second ball only moves in one direction along the horizontal groove. It appears on the right side and moves left towards the center, where it stops; it does not move back to the right."
0625-3,"No, the second ball does not follow a circular path or move in a loop. It moves in a straight line along the horizontal track segment from right to left towards the center."
0625-7,A
0627-0,"**The woman** is changing her position in the video.

**Explanation:** She starts behind the green cardboard cutout and then moves to peek around its side, shifting her body and location relative to the cutout and the camera."
0627-1,"**Answer:** Both the woman and the camera operator changed position.

**Explanation:** The woman is seen moving behind the cutout, shifting from one side to the other. Simultaneously, the person filming moves the camera around the cutout, changing the viewing angle significantly."
0627-2,"**No**, the photographer (the person holding the camera) is moving around the cardboard cutout.

**Explanation:** The photographer moves the camera to change the viewing angle. This demonstrates how the optical illusion works – the creature's head appears to follow the camera due to its concave shape and the way it's painted. The woman behind the cutout stays in roughly the same place, although she might adjust slightly; her apparent change in position relative to the cutout is primarily caused by the camera's changing perspective, not by the photographer physically moving her."
0627-3,"**No, the woman does not move the cardboard cutout.**

**Explanation:** The woman walks around the stationary cardboard cutout. Her change in position relative to the cutout creates the optical illusion that the cutout's head is following her, but the cutout itself remains in a fixed location."
0627-7,A
0633-0,"The wheels of the black car at the end of the video are turning **forward** (clockwise when viewed from the left side as shown).

**Explanation:** The car is driving forward on the snowy road, and the wheels rotate in the direction required to propel the vehicle forward."
0633-1,"**Counter-clockwise.**

**Explanation:** At the conclusion of the video (around 0:18-0:19), the black car is shown driving forward. When viewed from the left side, as in the video, the wheels rotate counter-clockwise to propel the car forward."
0633-2,**No.** The video ends with a static close-up shot of the black car's wheel fitted with red snow chains; the wheel is not rotating forward.
0633-3,"**No**, the wheels of the black car are not turning in reverse at the end of the video.

**Explanation:** The black car is shown driving forward through the snow at the end of the clip, and the visible front wheel is rotating in the correct direction (clockwise when viewed from the left side) for forward motion."
0633-7,B
0643-0,"Based on the video, the wind is blowing from the right side towards the left side of the frame. This is evident as the flag held by the soldier on the right consistently billows towards the left."
0643-1,"You can determine the wind direction by observing the direction the main Olympic flag billows and which way its free end points once it is unfurled and held steady. In the video, the flag is pushed towards the left (viewer's perspective) and slightly behind the soldiers, indicating the wind is blowing in that direction."
0643-2,"Yes, the wind is blowing from the left to the right side of the screen. This is shown by the flag held by the soldier on the right billowing strongly towards the right."
0643-3,"**Yes.** The flag being raised by the soldier on the right clearly billows out towards the left side of the screen, indicating the wind is blowing from right to left."
0643-7,D
0645-0,"**Answer:** The left end of the scarf (from the camera's perspective, initially held in the Student's left hand) is draped over the Student's right shoulder, hanging down her back at the end of the video."
0645-1,"**Answer:**
The left end of the student's scarf ends up hanging down vertically in front of the student, draped over their left shoulder, which is on the **right side from the camera's perspective**.

**Explanation:**
The student takes the end of the scarf initially held in their right hand (which appears on the left side of the screen) and wraps it around their neck. This action brings that end over their left shoulder, causing it to hang down on the side of their body that appears on the right side of the video frame by the end."
0645-2,"**Answer:** No.
**Explanation:** The student wraps the scarf around their neck, which causes the end initially on their left side to cross over and hang down on their right side by the end of the video."
0645-3,"**No**, the left end of the student's scarf is hanging down on the **left** side of her body at the end of the video."
0645-7,B
0652-0,"After the spin, the car ended up facing the opposite direction it was originally traveling, having moved significantly sideways across the lanes to come to rest on the paved surface near the right side of the highway."
0652-1,"**Answer:** The car ended up stopped on the paved surface of the highway, within the travel lanes and towards the left side, after spinning across multiple lanes."
0652-2,"**Yes**, the car spun across the lanes and came to a stop in the leftmost lane (innermost relative to the direction of travel), facing forward in the correct direction."
0652-3,"Yes, the car spins around on the wet highway and ends up facing the opposite direction from which it was originally traveling."
0652-7,D
0655-0,"**Answer:** The truck and the camera are moving at approximately the same speed.
**Explanation:** The camera maintains a relatively stable position alongside the truck to film it, indicating they are traveling at very similar velocities."
0655-1,"**Answer:** The camera and the truck are moving at approximately the same speed.

**Explanation:** To keep the truck consistently in the frame from a side-on perspective as shown in the video, the vehicle carrying the camera must travel alongside the truck at a very similar speed."
0655-2,"**Yes**, the camera is moving faster than the truck.

**Explanation:** The video shows the camera's viewpoint moving from behind the truck to alongside the driver's window. To overtake the truck like this, the camera must have been traveling at a higher speed."
0655-3,"**No.** The camera appears to be moving at approximately the same speed as the truck, allowing the filmer to keep the truck relatively stable within the frame while both are in motion."
0655-7,D
0658-0,"The rider in the black/dark grey jersey is faster. They gain the lead immediately after the start gate drops and maintain it throughout the visible portion of the race track, entering the corner well ahead of the other rider."
0658-1,"The rider in the black jersey (starting in the foreground/on the right) is quicker. They get a significantly faster start out of the gate, pull ahead immediately, and maintain a clear lead down the first straight and into the first corner."
0658-2,"Yes, the rider in the black outfit is the faster one during the race. They take the lead immediately after the start gate drops and maintain a clear advantage over the other rider throughout the visible portion of the track."
0658-3,"**Answer:** No, the rider in the white outfit is not the faster one.

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows the rider in the black outfit getting a quicker start off the ramp and establishing a significant lead over the rider in white almost immediately. The rider in black maintains and extends this lead throughout the visible portion of the race."
0658-7,A
0664-0,**10 times:** The woman picks up and rolls the dice ten separate times during the video clip to complete her turn and win the game.
0664-1,"**10**

**Explanation:**

The woman throws the dice ten times throughout the video clip. Each time she picks up the dice and rolls them into the box counts as one throw. She successfully closes all the tiles on her tenth throw."
0664-2,"**No**, the woman rolled the dice 10 times during the game shown in the video."
0664-3,"**No.**

The woman rolled the dice **10 times** in the video sequence to shut the box, not 11 times."
0664-7,B
0667-0,"**6 people** participated in the challenge.

**Explanation:** The video explicitly shows six different individuals (Celine, Bram, Laura, Ise, Michiel, and Anna) taking a turn to hit the balloon from the upper level and attempt to hit it again before it touches the ground."
0667-1,"**7 Participants**

**Explanation:** There are six individuals who take turns dropping the balloon and attempting the challenge (Celine, Bram, Laura, Ise, Michiel, and Anna), plus one additional person sitting on the stairs observing throughout the video."
0667-2,"**No, there are five people actively participating in the challenge.**

**Explanation:** The video shows five individuals taking turns dropping the balloon from the upper level or attempting to keep it airborne on the lower level. A sixth person is present, sitting on the stairs, but they do not engage in the game activity."
0667-3,"**No**, there are six people shown in the video. Five people are actively participating in the challenge (one dropping the balloon and four trying to keep it up), while one person is sitting on the stairs observing."
0667-7,C
0670-0,"**Two children jumped into the water.**

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows two different children jumping from the floating dock into the water one after the other between the 0:12 and 0:15 timestamps."
0670-1,"**Answer:** 2 children.
**Explanation:** The video shows two different children jumping off the dock into the water around the 0:12 and 0:14 marks."
0670-2,"**False.** The video shows several children jumping into the water from the floating dock at different times, including some doing backflips. The total number of children jumping exceeds two."
0670-3,"**No, the video does not show four children jumping into the water.**

Only one child (a boy) is clearly shown jumping from the dock around the 0:13 mark. The other jumps depicted are performed by the adult man narrating the video."
0670-7,B
0673-0,"**Answer:** 4 Buckets

**Explanation:** There are four yellow buckets shown that contain (or initially contained) real popcorn: one held by the woman next to the prankster, one each by the two people in the row behind them, and one partially visible to the far right."
0673-1,"**Answer:** 3
**Explanation:** There are three yellow, cylindrical movie theater buckets containing actual popcorn visible in the video, held by the people sitting behind and to the right of the person with green hair. The item initially held by the person with green hair is a flat prop with popcorn attached, not a bucket."
0673-2,"No, there are not exactly two buckets of real popcorn; there are three buckets shown containing real popcorn being eaten by the moviegoers (one held by the girl and two by the people sitting behind)."
0673-3,"**No.**

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows one person holding fake popcorn attached to a napkin/cardboard, which is then revealed with a ""FAKE"" sign. Only the other three individuals have buckets containing real popcorn at the start of the clip."
0673-7,C
0675-0,"Based on the video, the man on the left felt **amused and playful**.

**Explanation:** He consistently smiles and laughs throughout the video, even after the tricks are revealed. His exaggerated expressions, particularly after the thumb trick reveal, suggest he is playing along and enjoying the performance collaboratively with the younger man, rather than being genuinely surprised or fooled. He seems entertained by the simplicity of the tricks and the shared interaction."
0675-1,"**Reaction:** The man on the left reacted with exaggerated or feigned shock, playful surprise, and amusement each time the trick was revealed.

**Why:** He was a willing and good-natured participant in what appears to be a planned comedic skit. His reactions were performative and exaggerated to enhance the humor of revealing very simple magic props and tricks, indicating he was ""in on the joke"" rather than genuinely fooled."
0675-2,"**No**, the man on the left appears amused and entertained throughout the video. His reactions, including smiling, laughing, and playful surprise, suggest he enjoyed participating in the magic tricks and their reveals, rather than feeling displeased about being ""exposed."""
0675-3,"No, the man on the left did not seem impressed or intrigued after the magic tricks were explained. His reactions consistently showed amusement and entertainment at the simple props and reveals, rather than awe or deep curiosity about how the tricks were performed."
0675-7,B
0679-0,"**Answer:** The lady feels shocked and surprised.

**Explanation:** Her wide-open mouth, wide eyes, and fixed stare at the now seatless stool post are clear indicators of shock and surprise in reaction to the man unexpectedly unscrewing and taking the stool seat."
0679-1,"**Reaction:** Shock and Bewilderment.

**Explanation:** The woman's eyes widen significantly and her mouth drops open as she witnesses the man remove the top of the stool. She stops eating and stares in disbelief at the remaining stool pole, eventually pointing at it, indicating both shock at the unexpected event and bewilderment as to why or how it happened."
0679-2,"Yes, the woman feels surprised at the end of the video. Her facial expression, with her mouth wide open and eyes widened in shock, clearly indicates surprise when she notices the man has removed the top of the stool he was sitting on."
0679-3,"**No, the woman does not appear upset or frustrated.**

Her reaction, characterized by wide eyes, an open mouth, and pointing at the broken stool, clearly indicates shock and surprise at the sudden and unexpected event, rather than anger or frustration."
0679-7,B
0689-0,"Based on the video, the man in the purple T-shirt changed the other man's lock screen wallpaper to his own photo primarily **as a prank intended for humor and to create entertaining social media content.**

**Explanation:** The act is clearly a practical joke designed to get a surprised reaction from his friend. The prankster's laughter and wink towards the camera at the end strongly suggest the entire interaction was filmed specifically to be shared online as a funny video."
0689-1,"Based on the video, the man in the purple T-shirt altered the lock screen wallpaper primarily **as a simple, harmless prank for fun and amusement, aiming to playfully tease his friend and get a surprised or confused reaction.** It's also highly likely this was done **to create entertaining social media content**, given the filming style and the prankster's interaction with the camera at the end."
0689-2,"Yes, the man in the purple T-shirt changed the lock screen wallpaper to his own photo.

**Explanation:** The video shows him taking the phone, selecting a photo of himself from the gallery, using a menu option to set it as the wallpaper/lock screen, and then showing the phone back to the original owner, who reacts with surprise and confusion."
0689-3,"**Yes.** The video shows the man in the purple T-shirt selecting his own photo on the other person's phone, navigating the settings to set it as the lock screen wallpaper, and then revealing the change to the phone's owner while laughing and winking, clearly indicating it was done as a prank."
0689-7,A
0690-0,"The child is lying on the ground to watch the shell game her parents are playing on the coffee table directly above her. Her position gives her a unique, upward view of the game, and it appears to be part of a staged skit or video the family is creating."
0690-1,"Based on the video, the best reason the child is on the floor is that it's **part of a game or skit the family is filming for comedic effect.**

**Explanation:** The presence of the phone on a stand recording the scene, combined with the adults' exaggerated actions during the shell game and the child's unusual but seemingly intentional position directly under the table, strongly suggests they are creating staged content, likely for entertainment or social media, and her placement adds to the humor or uniqueness of the video."
0690-2,"Yes, the child is lying on the ground to secretly take the money during the trick.

**Explanation:** The child's position on the floor provides the necessary cover and proximity to reach under the table or bowl and remove the money while the adults are distracted by the shell game. The video shows the child reaching towards the table area just before the money is revealed to be missing, indicating their active participation in the staged trick."
0690-3,"The child is lying on the ground as part of **playing**.

**Explanation:** The child is actively looking up at the adults and the shell game they are playing on the coffee table. Her position and focused gaze indicate she is observing or participating as an audience member in the playful activity, rather than simply relaxing or resting."
0690-7,C
0695-0,"**The woman won the game.**

She successfully arranged her top row of cups (Orange, Green, Purple, Blue) to perfectly match the bottom row before the man did, and the off-camera voice confirmed her win by saying, ""You got it!"""
0695-1,"**The woman won the competition.**

**Explanation:** The game requires players to arrange four colored cups in a specific, hidden order. An off-screen voice announces how many cups are in the correct position after each attempt. The woman, on her final turn (around 0:41), arranged the cups as Orange, Green, Purple, Blue, and the voice announced ""4,"" indicating all cups were correctly placed. She celebrated immediately after, confirming her win. The man never achieved a score of 4."
0695-2,"**Yes, the woman won the game because she arranged her cups in the correct order.** The off-screen voice announced ""Four"" after her final turn, signifying that all four of her cups were in the correct positions, matching the hidden sequence and thus winning the game."
0695-3,"No, the man did not win the game. The woman won because she was the first to correctly arrange her cups to match the hidden sequence, achieving a score of ""Four"". The game is won by correctly matching the sequence, not by the speed at which the cups are arranged during a turn."
0695-7,A
0706-0,"The purpose of the man's actions in the first half of the video is **to capture the raw footage and specific movements needed as the base layer for a special effects video.**

**Explanation:** He is performing choreographed actions in front of the camera, which are then shown in the second half with added visual effects (like energy, a duplicate figure, and environmental effects) to create a short action/fantasy sequence."
0706-1,"Based on the video, the man is recording himself performing specific, dynamic actions and poses on the beach. This footage is intended to be the base layer or raw material onto which visual effects (like the clone, energy bursts, and ground cracking seen later) will be added during post-production to create the final edited video clip."
0706-2,"**Yes**, the man in the first half of the video is shooting footage for a video with special effects.

**Explanation:** The first half shows the man performing specific, dynamic actions in front of a camera on a tripod. The second half reveals the final product where visual effects (like a shadow clone, energy bursts, and ground cracking) have been added to that exact footage, demonstrating that the initial filming was done specifically to create the special effects sequence."
0706-3,"**Yes**, the man is setting up a camera on a tripod to record himself. The video shows him adjusting the camera, stepping back, and then performing dynamic movements that resemble martial arts or fight choreography in front of the camera."
0706-7,B
0707-0,"The purpose of the person running towards the camera is **to create a dynamic transition and prominently showcase the drink.**

**Explanation:** The run adds energy to the performance and directs the viewer's attention. It culminates in bringing the drink very close to the camera, making it the clear focal point of that moment in the video."
0707-1,"The person runs towards the camera to showcase the drink he is holding and to create a dynamic video transition effect, moving the drink closer to fill the frame before cutting to a close-up shot of it."
0707-2,**No.** The close-up of the drink is a separate shot that was clearly edited into the video during post-production. It wasn't captured by the person running towards the camera in the main wide shot; the abrupt cut and different framing indicate it's a distinct clip inserted later.
0707-3,"No, the person runs *away* from the camera. His specific introductory action is holding up his drink and pointing towards it/himself while facing the camera immediately after starting the recording."
0707-7,A
0708-0,"The cat screams in comedic frustration because its plan to destroy all the bath products was completely foiled when the owner revealed a large bag full of replacements, rendering the cat's destructive efforts futile."
0708-1,"The cat is yelling out of exaggerated horror and frustration at the sight of numerous new bath products.

**Explanation:** The video shows the cat disliking its bath and causing chaos with bath products. When the owner reveals a large haul of *new* bath items, the cat's final ""yell"" (likely a hiss or yawn edited for comedic effect) signifies its mock despair and protest at the anticipation of many more unwanted baths."
0708-2,"Yes.

**Explanation:** The video's humorous narrative shows the cat seemingly taking revenge for bath time by destroying bath products. The edited ""scream"" at the end occurs immediately after the owner reveals a large new supply of the same type of products, implying the cat is reacting with exaggerated dismay or frustration to its destructive efforts being instantly negated."
0708-3,"No, the cat is not screaming because it is upset about the mess.

**Explanation:** The video shows the cat deliberately pushing the bath products into the tub, thereby creating the mess itself. The final shot of the cat ""screaming"" (which is likely an edited clip of a hiss or yawn) is used for comedic effect to portray mischievousness or defiance, not genuine upset about the situation it caused."
0708-7,C
0721-0,"**Answer:** The man in sunglasses appears to be holding a LOT Polish Airlines airplane (likely a Boeing 787 Dreamliner).

**Explanation:** The video clip at 0:23 uses forced perspective to create an optical illusion where the man, standing on the ground with his hand raised, looks like he is holding the large passenger airplane flying low in the sky above him. The airline LOT is clearly visible on the aircraft."
0721-1,"He is holding his left hand palm-up directly beneath a low-flying airplane, while extending his right arm out, using forced perspective to create the optical illusion that he is supporting or holding the aircraft while posing for a photo."
0721-2,"**No, the man is not actually holding the airplane.** This is a photographic illusion called forced perspective, where the man is much closer to the camera than the distant airplane, making it appear as if he is interacting with it."
0721-3,"No, the man in sunglasses is not holding a toy airplane. This is an example of forced perspective photography, where a real, full-sized airplane in the background is aligned with the man's hand in the foreground to create an optical illusion, making it appear as though he is holding it."
0721-7,C
0723-0,"The monster appears active due to the **Hollow-Face Illusion**. Its head is actually built **concave** (hollowed inwards), but our brains are strongly wired to perceive faces as **convex** (bulging outwards). Because of this bias, the brain overrides the true depth cues. As the viewer moves, the relative shift of features on the concave surface (**motion parallax**) is misinterpreted by the brain as the convex face **turning to follow** the viewer."
0723-1,"The monster appears to move because its head is built with a concave (hollowed-in) structure, but our brains strongly interpret faces and heads as convex (sticking out), especially with the help of the painted shading. This misinterpretation causes a conflict with how perspective and motion cues work when the viewer moves; the brain resolves this conflict by perceiving the head as turning to follow the viewer. This is known as the hollow-face illusion."
0723-2,"**Yes**, the little monster appears to move due to an optical illusion involving its **concave** face. As confirmed in the video's audio (""inside-out cardboard box"") and explained by the provided answers, this is the hollow-face illusion where an indented (concave) face is perceived by the brain as convex (protruding), causing perspective shifts to be misinterpreted as the head turning to follow the viewer."
0723-3,"**Answer:** No, the monster cutout is not being physically manipulated or turned by the person.

**Explanation:** The apparent movement is an optical illusion, often related to the hollow-face illusion. The object is static, but its concave (""inside-out"") design tricks the brain into perceiving movement and that it's following the viewer as the camera's angle changes."
0723-7,D
0724-0,"The pen appears to pass through the banknote without breaking it because it's an illusion created by a specific folding technique. The pen doesn't actually pierce the paper.

The banknote is folded to create a hidden channel or gap. A common method is to fold the note in half lengthwise, then fold it widthwise, but ensuring one half is slightly offset or tucked behind the other. This creates a space *behind* the visible front surface of the note, through which the pen is slid, giving the illusion of penetration without causing any damage."
0724-1,"Okay, here's how the banknote is folded for the pen trick:

1.  **Fold Lengthwise:** The banknote is first folded in half along its length.
2.  **Fold Widthwise (with a Gap):** It's then folded in half widthwise, but this fold is done *imperfectly*. The edges are slightly offset or misaligned so that a small gap or channel is created along this central widthwise crease.

**Explanation:** The pen doesn't actually pierce the paper. It slides through the hidden gap created by the misaligned widthwise fold."
0724-2,"Yes, the banknote remains intact because the pen goes through the opening created by folding the banknote, not through the middle of the paper itself. This creates the illusion that the pen has pierced the note without actually damaging it."
0724-3,"**Yes.** The banknote is not broken because the pen is a specially designed magic prop. It typically has a hidden mechanism, such as separating into two pieces (often held by magnets) or containing a slot, which allows the folded banknote to be positioned *within* the pen's structure, creating the illusion that the pen has passed through it without causing any damage."

0725-0,"The drink level in the bottle decreases because a balloon hidden inside the bottle is deflating. The inflated balloon initially displaces the liquid, making the level appear higher. As the air escapes the balloon, it shrinks, taking up less space, and the liquid level drops to fill the volume the balloon previously occupied."
0725-1,"**Answer:**

The liquid level drops because a hidden balloon inside the bottle deflates.

**Explanation:**

As shown in the tutorial part of the video, a small hole was made in the side of the bottle, a balloon was inserted, inflated inside, and the hole was sealed. The inflated balloon displaces the Fanta, raising the liquid level. When the performer pretends to blow into the straw, air is actually released from the hidden balloon (likely through the sealed hole, possibly via a controlled leak or manipulation). As the balloon shrinks, it displaces less liquid, causing the level to fall. The action with the straw is misdirection."
0725-2,"**No, the drink level is not decreasing, and the balloon is not deflating.**

**Explanation:** The man sucks air *out* of the bottle's opening. This lowers the air pressure inside the bottle above the liquid. Because the air pressure *inside* the sealed balloon is now higher than the pressure outside it (within the bottle), the balloon *expands*. This expansion displaces the liquid, forcing the drink level to *rise* into the neck of the bottle."
0725-3,"**No**, the drink level is not decreasing because it is being consumed through the straw.

**Explanation:** It is a visual trick. The tutorial section of the video reveals that a balloon has been inserted into the bottle through a hidden hole and inflated. When the person appears to drink, they are actually letting air out of the hidden balloon (or squeezing the bottle), which causes the liquid level to drop, creating the illusion of consumption."
0725-7,A
0729-0,"**Red.**

**Explanation:** Due to the optical illusion presented in the video (similar to the Jastrow illusion), the lower red strip is perceived as shorter than the upper black strip, even though they are demonstrated to be the same length later."
0729-1,"**Black is longer.**

**Explanation:** The video uses a blue curved strip as a reference. When aligned with the inner curve of the red strip, the blue strip extends beyond it. When aligned with the inner curve of the black strip, the blue strip matches its length. This demonstrates that the inner curve of the black strip is longer than the inner curve of the red strip."
0729-2,"**No**, the black strip is not the longest.

**Explanation:** The video demonstrates through direct comparison using the blue strip (which is the same size as the red strip) that the red strip is longer than the black strip. Although the video incorrectly marks option A (""Black is long""), the visual evidence clearly shows the red strip has a greater length/span."
0729-3,"**No, the black strip is the longest.**

**Explanation:** The video uses a blue strip for comparison. It demonstrates that the blue strip's outer curve is longer than the red strip's, and the black strip's outer curve is longer than the blue strip's. This shows the order of length (longest to shortest) is Black > Blue > Red."
0729-7,A
0731-0,"Based on dual perception, the old man's nose looks like **a mermaid (or woman) sitting on a rock**.

*   **Explanation:** The shape that forms the bridge and tip of the old man's nose in the illusion is created by the figure of a blonde mermaid (identifiable by her tail) perched on a rock formation within the seascape."
0731-1,"The old man's nose represents **a mermaid sitting on a rock**.

**Explanation:** The shape commonly perceived as the nose of the larger face is formed by the figure of a mermaid, seen from the back with blonde hair, sitting atop a rock formation in the water."
0731-2,"**Yes**, the old man's nose in the optical illusion is indeed formed by the image of the mermaid sitting on the reef/rock.

**Brief Explanation:** The artist has cleverly designed the painting so that the smaller scene of the mermaid perched on the rock occupies the precise location and shape required to be perceived as the nose when viewing the larger, hidden face within the landscape."
0731-3,"**Yes**, the old man's nose can be perceived as the head and beak of the bird.

**Explanation:** The artist has cleverly positioned and shaped the bird so that its head and beak directly form the feature recognized as the nose within the larger optical illusion of the man's face."

0735-0,The scenery appeared on the artboard because the board was actually a mirror reflecting the real sunset scene behind the camera. The man pretended to paint on the mirror's surface for a creative visual effect.
0735-1,"**Method:** Using a mirror.
**Explanation:** The object placed on the easel is a mirror. It reflects the actual sunset scenery located behind the camera and easel, creating the illusion that the scene has been painted onto the board."
0735-2,"Yes, the scenery on the artboard in the second segment is a reflection of the environment. The object placed on the easel is a mirror, which captures the actual sunset over the water visible in the background."
0735-3,"No, the scenery on the artboard was not painted. It was a mirror placed on an easel, reflecting the actual sunset over the water behind it."

0738-0,"The man filmed the sky changing from black to bright by:

1.  **Locking the Auto Exposure/Auto Focus (AE/AF Lock)** by tapping and holding on the phone screen.
2.  **Manually decreasing the exposure** using the on-screen slider (sun icon) *before* starting the recording, making the scene appear dark.
3.  **Starting the video recording.**
4.  **Manually increasing the exposure** by dragging the slider back up *while* the video was recording, creating a smooth transition from dark to bright in real-time."
0738-1,"The man used the phone's **manual exposure adjustment** feature within the camera app.

**Explanation:** He first tapped the screen to set focus and initial exposure (often locking it, indicated by ""AE/AF LOCK""). Then, while recording, he **slid his finger upwards on the screen** next to the focus point. This action manually increased the exposure level in real-time, making the initially dark scene progressively brighter."
0738-2,"**No**, the man did not change the sky from black to bright.

**Explanation:** The actual scene was already a sunset. The man used the phone's camera controls to lower the *exposure* (how much light the camera captures), making the bright sunset *appear* dark on the phone screen and at the beginning of the recording. The final video clip then shows a transition from this artificially darkened state back to the actual brightness of the sunset."
0738-3,"**No**, the man in the video did not use a time-lapse feature.

**Explanation:** The video shows the user manually lowering the camera's exposure by dragging the sun icon down and then locking the Auto Exposure/Auto Focus (AE/AF Lock). This makes the initial scene appear very dark. He then records a standard video, and as the natural sunset progresses, the light appears brighter relative to the locked, underexposed setting. This is an exposure control technique, not time-lapse, which compresses time by recording frames at intervals."

0740-0,"**Answer:** Calculating 8 ÷ 2

**Explanation:**
1.  **Step 1 (Parentheses):** The expression inside the parentheses is calculated first: (2 + 2) = 4.
2.  **Step 2 (Rewrite):** The expression becomes 8 ÷ 2(4).
3.  **Step 3 (Division):** According to PEMDAS/BODMAS, multiplication and division have equal priority and are performed from left to right. The leftmost operation is 8 ÷ 2, which is calculated next."
0740-1,"The third step is **multiplying 4 by 4** (or calculating 4(4)).

**Explanation:**
1.  **Step 1 (Parentheses):** Calculate `(2 + 2) = 4`. The expression becomes `8 ÷ 2(4)`.
2.  **Step 2 (Division - Left to Right):** Perform the division `8 ÷ 2 = 4`. The expression becomes `4(4)`.
3.  **Step 3 (Multiplication - Left to Right):** Perform the multiplication `4 * 4 = 16`."
0740-2,"Yes, the third step shown in the video is performing the multiplication of 4 × 4.

**Explanation:**
1.  **Parentheses:** The expression inside the parentheses (2+2) is calculated first, resulting in 4. The problem becomes 8 ÷ 2(4).
2.  **Division (Left-to-Right):** According to the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), multiplication and division have equal priority and are performed from left to right. Therefore, the division 8 ÷ 2 is performed next, resulting in 4. The problem becomes 4(4).
3.  **Multiplication:** The third and final step is performing the multiplication 4(4), which equals 16."
0740-3,"Yes. After solving the parentheses (2+2=4) to get 8 ÷ 2(4), the video applies the PEMDAS/BODMAS rule. Since multiplication and division have equal priority, they are performed from left to right. The leftmost operation, 8 ÷ 2, is calculated next, which is the third step shown in the calculation process."

0742-0,"**x = 18**.

**Explanation:**
The diagram shows three adjacent angles (x°, 2x°, and 2x°) that together form a right angle (90°). Therefore, their sum must equal 90 degrees.

x + 2x + 2x = 90
5x = 90
x = 90 / 5
x = 18"
0742-1,"To determine the value of x in the given diagram:

1.  Recognize that the angles lie on a straight line, which totals 180°.
2.  Identify the right angle, indicated by the square symbol, which measures 90°.
3.  The remaining angles (x°, 2x°, and 2x°) must sum up to the other 90° to complete the straight line (180° - 90° = 90°).
4.  Set up the equation: x + 2x + 2x = 90.
5.  Combine the terms involving x: 5x = 90.
6.  Solve for x by dividing both sides by 5: x = 90 / 5.
7.  Calculate the value: x = 18."
0742-2,"Yes, the value of x is 18.

The diagram shows angles x°, 2x°, and 2x° adjacent to a 90° angle on a straight line. These angles must also sum to 90°. Therefore, x + 2x + 2x = 90, which simplifies to 5x = 90. Dividing both sides by 5 gives x = 18."
0742-3,"**No, the value of x is not 25.**

The video explains that the angles x°, 2x°, and 2x° add up to the adjacent 90° angle. Therefore, x + 2x + 2x = 90°, which simplifies to 5x = 90°. Dividing 90 by 5 gives x = 18."

0749-0,"**Uncooked rice grains** pass through the sieve.

*Explanation:* The individual rice grains are small enough to fall through the mesh openings due to gravity, whereas the liquid shown next is held by surface tension, and the powder clings together and to the sieve."
0749-1,"Based on the video, the materials that pass through the sieve are **fine particles**, **powder**, and generally any **particles smaller than the mesh size** of the sieve.

**Explanation:**
In the first part (0:00-0:03), when the sieve is used with the granular material (like rice), only smaller pieces or dust fall through. In the second part (0:06-0:09), when the sieve is dipped into powder (like flour), the powder easily passes through the mesh openings because its particles are fine enough."
0749-2,"**Answer:** No, the rice does not pass through the sieve, but the yellow substance (which appears to be liquid or a fine suspension) does.

**Explanation:** The sieve's mesh openings are smaller than the rice grains, preventing them from passing through. However, the yellow substance is either a liquid or made of particles fine enough to flow through the openings."
0749-3,"**No, the flour does not pass through the sieve.**

The video shows the flour mounding on top of the sieve's mesh and being retained, indicating that the particles, possibly due to clumping or bridging the gaps, do not fall through the openings."

0755-0,"The material of the sponge is **cake** (likely **sponge cake**).

**Explanation:** The woman bites into and eats the ""sponge,"" and other items presented in the video are later revealed to be cake when cut, indicating it's part of an ""illusion food"" trend where everyday objects are recreated as edible desserts."
0755-1,"The sponge shown in the video is an edible item made to look like a real cleaning sponge. It is likely composed primarily of **cake** (for the yellow, porous part) and possibly **fondant, modeling chocolate, or textured icing** (for the green scouring layer), held together and colored with **edible food coloring** and other **confectionery** ingredients."
0755-2,"Yes, the sponge in the video is made of an edible material like cake. The woman is shown biting and chewing it, and the video later reveals other objects (like a bowl of noodles and a cleaning bucket) are also hyper-realistic cakes, indicating the sponge is part of this edible illusion theme."
0755-3,"**No, the sponge in the video is not made of synthetic materials like polyurethane foam.** The video clearly shows the person biting into the object, revealing it to be an edible cake made to look like a sponge, not an actual cleaning sponge."

0762-1,"The second boat was made of **Sheets of Paper**.

**Explanation:** The video shows a white, block-like structure corresponding to the paper emoji (📄). When the person steps onto it, it immediately collapses and sinks, consistent with the behavior of stacked paper getting wet."
0762-2,"Yes, the second boat appears to be made of paper. The corresponding emoji shown is a stack of paper, and the white object sinks immediately when the person steps onto it, which is consistent with the properties of paper in water under load."

**The canned Coke that was taken away by the hand is the real one.**

**Explanation:** The hand physically interacts with and moves this can, demonstrating it's a tangible, 3D object. The can that remains stationary is revealed to be a 2D image or drawing placed behind the real can, creating the optical illusion."
0763-1,"The can removed by the hand is the genuine one.

**Explanation:** The video demonstrates optical illusions. The can that remains stationary is likely a 2D drawing or print designed to look 3D from the camera's perspective, creating the illusion. The can that the hand physically places and then removes is the actual, tangible object."
0763-2,"Yes, the can that was taken away was a real canned Coke.

**Explanation:** Both cans shown in that segment of the video appear to be real, physical objects. The can that is removed has a 3D shape, reflections, and interacts physically with the hand, indicating it is a tangible item, not a drawing or illusion like some other examples in the video."
0763-3,"Yes, the Coke can that is still in the picture appears to be a real, physical can.

**Explanation:** The video segment shows a hand picking up and manipulating what looks like a standard, real Coke can. The visual details, like reflections and how it's held, are consistent with a tangible object. The illusion demonstrated likely involves editing or perspective tricks rather than the can itself being fake."

0779-0,"**Illusion:** Penrose Triangle (Impossible Object Illusion) achieved through Forced Perspective.

**How:** The object is a single, specially designed piece, not nine separate cubes. Its specific physical geometry is constructed so that only when viewed from one precise angle do its edges and surfaces align perfectly to create the visual illusion of the impossible Penrose Triangle structure made of cubes. Rotating the object breaks this alignment and reveals its true, non-cubical form."
0779-1,"**Illusion:** The illusion is a physical representation of the **Penrose Triangle** (also known as the Impossible Triangle or Tribar), made to appear as if constructed from connected orange cubes.

**How it works:** The illusion is created using **forced perspective**. The physical object is not actually a closed, continuous triangle of cubes. It is cleverly constructed with specific breaks, gaps, and angled surfaces. When viewed from one precise angle (as shown at the start of the video), these elements align visually, tricking the brain into perceiving a solid, geometrically impossible structure. Rotating the object changes the viewing angle, breaking the alignment and revealing its true, non-continuous shape."
0779-2,"**Yes**, the video shows a physical object designed to create the Penrose Triangle optical illusion. From the initial specific angle, it successfully appears to be made of nine interconnected, floating cubes. However, when the object is rotated, its true form is revealed – it is a single piece with strategically shaped, non-cubical, and concave structures that only create the illusion of cubes from that particular viewpoint."
0779-3,"**Yes**, the illusion is achieved by aligning separate block segments so that, when viewed from a specific angle, they appear to form a continuous, impossible triangle (a Penrose triangle). Rotating the object reveals the gaps and the true arrangement of the blocks, breaking the illusion."

0790-0,"**Answer:** Rotate the sheet 90 degrees so it is held vertically, parallel to the blue tube.

**Explanation:** The video demonstrates that when the sheet is held horizontally, the vertical blue tube disappears. When the sheet is rotated 90 degrees and held vertically (aligning its length with the blue tube), the blue tube becomes visible while the horizontal red and green tubes disappear. This indicates the sheet is a polarizing filter, and holding it vertically aligns its transmission axis with the vertically oriented blue tube, allowing light from it to pass through."
0790-1,"**Answer:** Rotate the sheet 90 degrees so it is oriented vertically.

**Explanation:** The video demonstrates that when the sheet is held horizontally (parallel to the red and green tubes), the vertical blue tube disappears behind it. When the sheet is rotated 90 degrees to a vertical orientation (parallel to the blue tube), the blue tube becomes visible through the sheet, while the horizontal tubes disappear. This indicates the sheet acts as a polarizing filter, transmitting light aligned with its orientation."
0790-2,"**Yes.**

As shown in the video, when the transparent sheet is rotated 90 degrees (from horizontal to vertical), the vertically oriented blue tube becomes clearly visible through it."
0790-3,"**No.**

According to the video, rotating the sheet by 45 degrees makes all the tubes behind it blurry and disappear (0:27-0:31). To see the blue tube clearly, the sheet must be held vertically (rotated 90 degrees from the initial horizontal position), as shown between 0:18 and 0:23."

0794-1,"**The white cat** is the 'friend' described in the caption.

**Explanation:** The video builds suspense around the white cat preparing to jump from the ledge. Its jump causes the black dog below to flee, suggesting the cat's action was unexpected and perceived as untrustworthy or startling by the dog."
0794-2,"**Yes.** The white cat is shown on the ledge at the beginning and leaves just before the second cat (whose perspective the video seems to follow) jumps down towards waiting dogs. This sequence strongly implies the white cat is the ""friend"" who abandoned the second cat, fitting the caption ""Never trust your friend""."
0794-3,"**Yes**, the black dog is the 'friend' referred to in the caption.

0803-1,"The object on fire is **a bundle of matches**.

**Explanation:** The burning object clearly consists of numerous individual matchsticks grouped tightly together, likely stuck into a base, with their heads ignited simultaneously to create a large, unified flame."
0803-2,"Yes, it is true that a bunch of candles is burning in the video. The blue object in the center of the tray has multiple wicks, each lit and producing a flame, characteristic of burning candles bundled together."
0803-3,"**No, the burning object is not a sponge.**

It appears to be a cluster or bundle of matches stuck into a base. The blue tips that are burning resemble match heads, and the flames originate from many distinct points, which is consistent with multiple matches burning simultaneously rather than a single sponge-like object."

0816-0,"**Action:** The person inverted the bottle of water, letting it drain without swirling it first.

**Explanation:** This demonstrates simple draining where air must intermittently bubble back into the bottle against the outflowing water, slowing the process compared to when a vortex is created."
0816-1,"**Action:** The person inverted the bottle and applied a swirling/circular motion with their hand/wrist.

**Explanation:** This action induced a rotational flow in the water, creating a vortex (whirlpool) which allowed air to enter the bottle simultaneously as water exited, resulting in much faster draining compared to the first experiment."
0816-2,"Yes, the person spun the bottle to create a vortex in the second experiment.

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows the person swirling the bottle in a circular motion (around 0:10) before inverting it for the second draining attempt. This action imparted rotation to the water, leading to the formation of the visible vortex as the water flowed out."
0816-3,"No, the straw was not inserted during the second experiment.

**Explanation:** The video shows three distinct attempts to empty the bottle. The second experiment (starting around 0:09) involves swirling the water to create a vortex, which speeds up draining. The straw is only introduced in the third experiment (starting around 0:15)."

**Explanation:** The video explicitly shows the setup phase where the person is supported by a stool and helper, contrasting it with the final edited image where the person appears to float horizontally above their own body on the sand, demonstrating the technique used to achieve this illusion."
0833-1,"**Answer:**

The fourth segment depicts the setup and the final edited photograph for a levitation illusion under a pier. In the final image, a man is shown lying on the sand, while a semi-transparent version of himself appears to be floating horizontally above him.

**Explanation:**

The video first shows the behind-the-scenes setup: one man lies on the sand, while another helps him balance horizontally on a stool under the pier, and a photographer prepares the shot. It then cuts to the final edited image where the stool is removed, and the man appears to be levitating or having an ""out-of-body"" experience, floating above his physical body on the sand. This combines elements from descriptions 1, 2, 3, and 7."
0833-2,"**Yes**, the fourth segment (0:19-0:24) shows the setup for and the final edited image of a man lying on the sand under a pier, with a semi-transparent image of himself floating above, visually representing the idea of a soul or spirit."

**Explanation:** By chatting casually or even misleading the riders (e.g., suggesting a malfunction), the operator distracts them and lowers their guard. This makes the sudden, unexpected activation of the drop far more shocking and intense, amplifying the fear, adrenaline rush, and overall memorability of the experience."
0854-1,"The operator talks to the visitors to distract them and catch them off guard before activating the drop. This creates surprise and shock, enhancing the thrill of the ride and making the experience more memorable by preventing the riders from mentally preparing for the exact moment of the drop."
0854-2,"**Answer:** Yes.
**Explanation:** The video's text explicitly states that the operator chats with visitors and then suddenly presses the start button, catching them psychologically unprepared. It also mentions he sometimes tricks visitors by saying the machine has malfunctioned, starting it when they are scared, which is clearly intended to increase their nervousness and fear for a more memorable experience."
0854-3,"**No**, the operator's conversation is not meant to help visitors feel prepared. The video commentary and the provided analysis indicate that the chat is used as a distraction or misdirection technique to make the sudden start of the ride more surprising and thrilling by catching the riders off guard."

0857-0,"The woman is imitating a **Barbie doll falling over**.

*   **Explanation:** Her stiff backward falls mimic how a rigid plastic doll would tip over. This action, combined with the ""Barbie Girl"" song playing (specifically referencing ""Barbie girl"" and ""life in plastic""), strongly suggests she is playfully acting out the movement of an inanimate doll falling."
0857-1,"Based on the video and the provided interpretations, the woman appears to be **acting like a doll**, specifically referencing the ""Barbie Girl"" song playing.

**Explanation:** Her repeated backward falls onto the sand, often going limp, mimic the way a toy doll might be dropped or tossed around during play, lacking its own control and resembling ragdoll physics. This action directly correlates with the lyrics and theme of the song ""Barbie Girl."""
0857-2,"**No.** The woman in the video falls backward and then forward onto a sand dune. Her movements appear playful or related to losing balance on the steep, soft sand, rather than mimicking the impact or reaction of being shot. There are no gestures or specific body movements typically associated with simulating being shot."
0857-3,"No, the woman is not imitating fainting. Her actions show her intentionally and playfully throwing herself backward and forward onto the soft sand dune in a controlled manner, rather than simulating the sudden, involuntary loss of consciousness and limp collapse associated with fainting."
0857-7,A
0858-0,"**Answer:** The man initially sat on the sitter's right armrest.

**Explanation:** Although visually from the camera's angle it might appear he is sitting on the left armrest, the narration explicitly clarifies the optical illusion at 0:29, stating that he actually sat on the chair's right armrest (椅子的右扶手) from the perspective of someone sitting down."
0858-1,"Based on the video and the narration:

The man first tried to sit on the armrest that appears on the **viewer's left**. The narrator clarifies that due to the optical illusion, this structure is actually the chair's **right** armrest."
0858-2,"Yes, the man initially sat on the right armrest of the chair. The video explains that while it looks like he is sitting on the left armrest due to the optical illusion design of the chair, he actually sat on the right armrest."
0858-3,"**No**, the man did not initially sit on the left armrest.

**Explanation:** While the initial camera angle makes it appear as though he sits on the left armrest, this is due to an optical illusion created by the chair's design. The video's narration explicitly clarifies that he actually sat on the chair's right armrest."
0858-7,C
0865-0,"**Answer:** Two worms.

**Explanation:** At the end of the video, there are two distinct worm-like creatures visible on the ground: one brownish worm near the bird's beak and a green one (possibly a caterpillar) further away."
0865-1,"**Two worms.**

**Explanation:** At the conclusion of the video, both the brownish worm the bird was attempting to eat and a separate green worm (or caterpillar) nearby are visible on the ground."
0865-2,"No, there are two worm-like creatures visible at the end of the video. One is a brown worm near the bird's beak, and the other is a green caterpillar slightly further away."
0865-3,"Yes, at the end of the video, two worms are visible. One worm is held in the bird's beak, and another worm is lying on the ground nearby."
0865-7,B
0868-0,The tool swung at the beginning of the video is **red**. It appears to be a screwdriver with a red handle.
0868-1,"The tool used by the person at the start of the video is a screwdriver with a **red and black handle**.

**Explanation:** The handle of the screwdriver is predominantly red, but it also features a distinct black section where the handle meets the metal shaft."
0868-2,"**No**, the tool swung around the 0:03 mark is a standard claw hammer. It has a silver/grey metal head and a light brown wooden handle, not a silver-brownish metal head. The tool used at the very beginning (0:00) is a screwdriver, which is pushed, not swung."
0868-3,"Yes, the tool swung at the beginning of the video has a red handle. It is a screwdriver being used to try and make a hole in the bottom of a bowl."
0868-7,B
0870-0,"Based on the video, the man gave his belongings to the photographer because:

The interaction appears staged for the video. The man complied with the photographer's non-verbal prompts (pointing at the items) as part of a planned sequence, likely driven by desperation and the hope of receiving better assistance (food, money, umbrella) in return for giving up his inadequate shelter and collection hat."
0870-1,"The man is likely participating in a **staged performance** and **following instructions** from the person filming. He hands over his belongings because the scene requires it to create the video's narrative arc, showing initial hardship followed by receiving help, aiming for emotional impact."
0870-2,"**No**, the man did not give his belongings to the photographer out of kindness to help *them*.

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows the man and child in a state of need, receiving assistance (food, money, snacks, an umbrella) from the person filming (the photographer). The man hands over the piece of cardboard he was using for shelter only after the photographer gestures towards it, and this happens within the context of him receiving aid. His action is better understood as compliance or interaction with someone helping him, rather than an act of generosity directed *towards* the photographer. The flow of help is entirely from the photographer to the man and child."
0870-3,"**No**, the man did not give his belongings to the photographer. The video shows the photographer providing aid to the man and child, giving them food, snacks, drinks, an umbrella, and money without receiving anything in return. The interaction was an act of charity, not an exchange."
0870-7,A
0871-0,"Based on the video, the best description is:

**A person interacting with a pink object, followed by a digital distortion effect.**

**Explanation:** Initially, a person is seen bending down towards a pink object in the middle of the road. Subsequently, a visual effect is applied that dramatically stretches the person's image vertically."
0871-1,"**Answer:** A person using a video filter.

**Explanation:** The object in the center of the road is a person whose image is being dramatically stretched vertically by a video filter or visual effect."
0871-2,"**No, the video does not show a chalk drawing.**

**Explanation:** The figure in the video is a real person whose image has been heavily distorted by a visual effect or filter, causing extreme vertical stretching as they bend down towards a pink object on the road. The movement clearly indicates it is video footage of a person, not a static chalk drawing."
0871-3,"**No:** The person in the video is holding one large, pink object, not two bags."
0871-7,D
0872-0,"**To the right.**

*   *Explanation:* After placing both packs down beside the seated man, the standing man uses his hand to slide the top pack towards the right side of the video frame."
0872-1,"**No Direction / Not Moved**

**Explanation:** The younger man places two packs of water bottles on the ground. The seated man then takes individual bottles *out* of the pack on the right (from the camera's viewpoint) to give to people, but the pack itself remains stationary on the ground and is not moved as a whole unit."
0872-2,"**No**, the man did not move the upper water bottle pack to the left after placing them down. He placed both packs down together as a single stack and did not adjust the position of the upper pack relative to the lower one afterwards."
0872-3,"**Answer:** No.

**Explanation:** The younger man places two packs of water bottles down, one on top of the other. The older man then takes individual bottles from the top pack, but he does not move the entire upper pack to the right after it was initially placed."
0872-7,B
0875-0,"There is **one cell phone** on the piano. It is black and located on the left side of the piano, near the keyboard."
0875-1,"**Answer:** 1
**Explanation:** There is one cell phone clearly visible placed on the left side of the piano surface throughout the video."
0875-2,"**Answer:** No.

**Explanation:** There are two cell phones visible near the piano. One phone has a green case, but the other phone has a dark-colored case (with a circular attachment), not a light-colored case."
0875-3,"**Yes**, there appears to be only one cell phone resting on the piano, and it is positioned on the far left side, to the left of the pianist's hands."
0875-7,D
0879-0,"After the fourth second, the figures are all stationary Lego minifigures positioned on different parts of the same white physical object. It has been demonstrated (by the pencil) that they are part of an optical illusion and are *not* actually standing on a single, continuous plane, despite appearing to do so from the camera's perspective."
0879-1,"Starting from the fourth second, the figures share these characteristics:

*   They are revealed to be on **disconnected structures** (7) and therefore **not on the same plane** (1).
*   They remain **Lego minifigures** (2) positioned on parts of a **white structure** (3) as part of an **optical illusion setup** (4).

**Explanation:** From the fourth second, the camera angle changes, breaking the optical illusion of the Penrose triangle. This reveals that the Lego figures, which initially appeared to be on a single continuous plane, are actually positioned on separate, disconnected pieces of the white structure. They remain identifiable as Lego figures throughout this reveal."
0879-2,"**No.** The object is a Penrose triangle, which is an optical illusion. The surfaces the figures are standing on only appear to be connected and part of the same plane due to the specific camera angle; they cannot physically exist as a single continuous plane in 3D space."
0879-3,"**No.**

**Explanation:** The object is a Penrose triangle, which is an optical illusion. The surfaces the two figures are standing on only *appear* to be connected and on the same plane due to the specific camera angle. In physical reality, these surfaces are separate and not coplanar."
0879-7,E
0880-0,"**Answer:**
When the person holds up the mirror with their hand, the state of direction changes by introducing a reflection of the arrow which points in the opposite horizontal direction (left) compared to the real arrow (right).

**Explanation:**
This happens because a plane mirror creates a virtual image that is laterally inverted (flipped horizontally) relative to the object. Therefore, the reflection of the right-pointing arrow appears to point left."
0880-1,"**Answer:**

The perceived direction of the structure remains unchanged, consistently appearing to point to the right, even when it is lifted by hand and physically rotated 180 degrees.

**Explanation:**

This phenomenon is an optical illusion caused by the specific ambiguous 3D geometry of the object. From the viewing angle shown, the shape is designed such that even after a 180-degree rotation around its vertical axis, its silhouette or most prominent features still present an image that the brain interprets as pointing to the right. The mirror test later in the video confirms the physical rotation (the reflection points left), but the direct view of the object maintains the rightward-pointing illusion."
0880-2,"Yes, the structure loses its directional illusion when held up towards the camera.

**Explanation:** The illusion works because the specific 3D shape, when viewed from a relatively level angle, consistently projects a 2D image that looks like an arrow pointing in one direction, even when rotated. Tilting the object towards the camera changes the viewing perspective significantly. This altered angle reveals the actual complex curves and geometry of the object, breaking the specific projection needed to maintain the illusion of a simple, consistently pointing arrow."
0880-3,"**No.** The structure's direction changes because it is physically rotated 180 degrees by the hand when lifted off its mount. The mirror simply reflects the arrow's actual orientation at any given moment, exhibiting the standard left-right reversal characteristic of a plane mirror; the mirror itself does not cause the change in the object's direction when lifted."
0880-7,C
0886-0,"**Answer:** The watch is worn on the man's left wrist.

**Explanation:** The watch is clearly visible on his left wrist throughout the video as he handles the cans and the tube."
0886-1,"**Answer:** The man is wearing the watch on his left wrist.
**Explanation:** The watch is visible on his left wrist throughout the video, particularly when he raises his hands at the start and while handling the tube. His right wrist is bare."
0886-2,"**No, the watch is on his left wrist.** The video clearly shows the watch on the man's left arm, especially when he raises both hands at the beginning."
0886-3,"Yes, the watch is worn on the left wrist of the man in black. It is clearly visible when he raises his arms at the beginning of the video and throughout the experiment."
0886-7,C
0895-0,"**Answer:** The scene cuts to a basketball hoop with a rim that appears to be made from or surrounded by a chainsaw chain.

**Explanation:** The video shows the successful shot into the ""mini hoop"" ending around the 0:07 mark. Immediately following this, the scene changes to show a different basketball hoop, labeled ""chainsaw rim"" in the on-screen text, which has a distinctively modified rim resembling a chainsaw chain."
0895-1,"The smaller basketball goes cleanly into the mini hoop, and a green checkmark appears on screen confirming the successful shot."
0895-2,"**Yes**, the scene cuts from the person successfully shooting into the mini hoop to a scene where they shoot into a hoop with a chainsaw blade acting as the rim."
0895-3,"Yes, the video cuts to a person shooting at a mini hoop immediately after the first shot attempt (at the spiked hoop). This transition occurs at the 0:03 mark."
0895-7,A
0898-0,"**Answer:** Towards the center of the whirlpool.

**Explanation:** After the man places the first pillow on the digitally created water effect, it immediately begins to drift away from the couch and directly towards the central, darker area of the swirling vortex."
0898-1,"**Answer:** Towards the center of the vortex.

**Explanation:** Once the first pillow landed on the water effect near the edge, it immediately started moving inwards towards the central swirling point of the vortex."
0898-2,"**No, the man did not move the first pillow closer to the camera after it was on the water.**

**Explanation:** The video shows the man throwing the first pillow onto the floor effect. It lands and remains stationary. He then throws a second pillow and steps onto the pillows without adjusting the position of the first one after it landed."
0898-3,"**No:** The man throws the first pillow onto the 'water', then throws a second pillow closer to himself and steps onto the second one. He does not interact with the first pillow again after throwing it."
0898-7,D
0901-0,"**Answer:** 1

**Explanation:** At the 00:00 mark of the video, there is visibly only one green rubber band stretched between the fingers of both hands."
0901-1,"**Answer:** 1
**Explanation:** At the start of the video (0:00), the person is holding a single green rubber band stretched between the fingers of both hands."
0901-2,"No, the hand is holding only one green rubber band at the beginning of the video. It is stretched between the index finger and thumb of both hands."
0901-3,"**Yes**, the video clearly shows only one green rubber band stretched between the fingers of both hands at the very beginning (0:00)."
0901-7,C
0905-0,"**Uphill (Apparent/Illusion)**

**Explanation:** At the beginning of the video, from the specific camera angle shown, the slope where the marble is placed *appears* to be uphill. This is because when released, the marble rolls towards the center platform, which looks like the highest point of that ramp section in the optical illusion. The later part of the video reveals that all ramps actually slope downwards towards the center."
0905-1,"**Answer:** Apparent Incline

**Explanation:** At the start of the video, due to the specific camera angle and the design of the object (an optical illusion), the surface where the marble is placed visually appears to be an incline sloping upwards towards the center."
0905-2,"Yes, the slope where the ball is located at the beginning of the video is a downhill slope.

**Explanation:** Although the initial camera angle creates an optical illusion making it seem like the marble rolls uphill, the video later reveals (at 0:17) that the structure is actually composed of four ramps, all sloping downwards towards the center. The marble rolls towards the center because that is the lowest point, following the laws of gravity."
0905-3,"**No, the slope is actually downhill.**

The video explains and demonstrates that the object is a 3D-printed optical illusion. While it appears the marble rolls uphill from the initial camera angle, rotating the object reveals that all four ramps actually slope downwards towards the center. The marble starts at the higher, outer edge and rolls down to the lower central point."
0905-7,B
0907-0,"The dog lands on the **grass** in the backyard.

**Explanation:** After the man jumps on the seesaw, the dog is launched into the air and lands on the green, grassy surface of the yard."
0907-1,"The dog lands on the grass to the right of the seesaw, near its starting position."
0907-2,"**No**, the dog does not land on the man's body. It lands on the grass beside him, near his legs/buttocks area, after being launched by the seesaw."
0907-3,"Yes, the dog lands on the grass at the end of the video. After being launched by the seesaw, the dog lands and rolls on the grassy lawn."
0907-7,B
0910-0,"The man repeatedly picks up the child as a form of playful interaction. It appears to be a game between them, likely intended to keep the child entertained and happy while they are walking on the sidewalk."
0910-1,"The man is repeatedly picking up the child as part of a playful interaction, likely for the purpose of filming content (e.g., for social media), aiming to be humorous or entertaining for both the child and potential viewers, as indicated by his pointing towards the camera near the end."
0910-2,"Yes, this appears to be a social experiment.

**Explanation:** The man repeatedly picks up the child in the same public area in front of different groups of people. This repetition, along with interactions like smiling and pointing towards the end (seen around 0:38-0:44), suggests the scenario is staged to observe how bystanders react, which is characteristic of a social experiment."
0910-3,"**No.** The man picks up the child and immediately walks along the sidewalk towards a building entrance, not towards the street or in a manner suggesting they are about to cross it."
0910-7,C
0914-0,"The bottle is placed under the hot water faucet to shrink the plastic sleeve label onto it. The heat from the water causes the sleeve to contract and conform tightly to the shape of the bottle, effectively applying the label."
0914-1,"The purpose is to use the running water to wash away a temporary, water-soluble black coating from the bottle. This reveals the actual product packaging underneath, showcasing a unique packaging feature."
0914-2,"**Yes**, the video demonstrates how hot water causes the loose plastic sleeve label to shrink and conform tightly to the shape of the beer bottle."
0914-3,"**No**, the bottle is placed under the faucet to apply a heat-shrink sleeve label using hot water, not to cool the beer. The faucet is marked ""Hot Water,"" and the heat causes the plastic sleeve to shrink tightly around the bottle."
0914-7,A
0918-0,"The man puts the soap in the box with his **right hand**.

He holds the container with his left hand and uses his right hand to pick up the soap shavings and place them inside."
0918-1,"The man uses his **right hand** to place the soap shavings into the box, while holding the box with his left hand."
0918-2,"Yes, the man uses his right hand to pick up the individual soap shavings and place them into the clear container he holds in his left hand."
0918-3,**No.** The man holds the container with his left hand and uses his right hand to pick up the soap shavings and place them inside the container.
0918-7,A
0919-0,"The man creates the rainbow by drawing colored stripes onto clear packing tape using markers. He then shines a phone flashlight through this colored tape in a dark room. The marker ink acts as a filter, allowing the light to project the colored stripes onto the wall as a rainbow pattern."
0919-1,"The man makes a rainbow appear by coloring the sticky side of clear packing tape with different colored markers in stripes. He then shines a phone flashlight through the center hole of the tape roll, using the colored tape section as a filter to project the colors onto the wall as a rainbow."
0919-2,"**Yes**, the man creates the rainbow effect by coloring stripes onto the clear tape with markers. He then shines a light (from his phone's flashlight) through the colored sections of the tape, which acts as a filter, projecting the rainbow pattern onto the wall."
0919-3,"**No**, the man does not use a prism. He creates the rainbow effect by coloring sections of clear tape with different colored markers. He then shines a light (from his phone's flashlight) through these colored sections, which act like filters, projecting the different colors onto the wall."
0919-7,C
0924-0,"**Answer:** A red book.
**Explanation:** At the end of the video, after the blue liquid is thrown, the red object that the woman in the white top was holding falls to the ground near her feet. This object is clearly identifiable as a book with a red cover."
0924-1,"The red item the woman in the white top is holding is a **book**.

**Explanation:** The item is rectangular, has a red cover, and when she drops it in surprise, white pages are visible inside. She is also holding it and looking down at it in a manner consistent with reading a book."
0924-2,"**No, the woman in the white top is not holding the red book at the end of the video.** She drops it on the ground after being splashed with blue liquid, and it is seen lying beside her chair."
0924-3,"No, the woman in the white top is not holding a red bottle at the end of the video. She was initially holding a book with a red cover, but after being splashed with blue liquid, she drops the book and is shown reacting with her hands empty."
0924-7,B
0926-0,"**Answer:** The **right hand** is pulling the thread.

**Explanation:** The video shows the thread stretched taut across the palm of the right hand. The right hand maintains this tension (pulling the thread) so that the left hand can rub the needle's eye against it effectively."
0926-1,"**Right hand.**

**Explanation:** The video shows the right hand holding the thread taut across the left palm. After the left hand rubs the needle eye across the thread, causing it to enter the eye, the right hand then pulls the end of the thread through the needle's eye to complete the threading process."
0926-2,"**No**, the right hand is not responsible for pulling the thread through the needle. It holds the thread taut and still, while the left hand moves the needle back and forth across the thread, using friction to guide the thread into the needle's eye."
0926-3,"**No**, the left hand is not responsible for pulling the thread through the needle.

**Explanation:** The left hand holds the thread taut and still across the palm. The right hand rubs the eye of the needle back and forth across the thread. This friction creates micro-vibrations that guide the thread into and through the needle's eye, as explained by the text overlay in the video. The left hand's role is passive stabilization, not active pulling."
0926-7,A
0927-0,"**Left arm:** The man uses his left arm, wrapped around the baby's back and under their bottom, to hold the child securely against his body."
0927-1,"The man uses his **left arm** to hold the child.

Explanation: The video clearly shows the man's left arm wrapped around the baby's back and under their bottom to support them, while his right arm is holding the popsicle."
0927-2,"Yes, the man holds the child securely with his left arm wrapped around the baby's body, while his right hand is clearly holding the red popsicle throughout the video."
0927-3,**No.** The man is holding the child with his left arm and holding the popsicle with his right hand.
0927-7,A
0929-0,"Both little girls showed curiosity by approaching and touching the living statue. When the statue moved unexpectedly, both were startled, quickly retreated, and immediately sought comfort and protection by running to and hiding behind an adult woman (presumably their mother), displaying a mixture of fear and nervous laughter/crying afterward."
0929-1,"Both the little girl in the green dress and the little girl in the blue dress behave similarly towards the statue performer in the following ways:

They both initially approach the performer out of curiosity and get close enough to interact (one touches, the other speaks). When the performer makes a subtle movement, both girls are startled, immediately retreat by running away, and seek comfort by running to and clinging to an adult woman. Both display strong emotional reactions involving fear and surprise, which causes amusement among the onlookers."
0929-2,"No, neither the little girl in the green dress nor the little girl in the blue dress tries to support the statue.

**Explanation:** Both girls touch the living statue performer, get startled when he moves towards them, and immediately jump or run away in surprise, seeking comfort from their guardians rather than attempting to hold the statue up."
0929-3,"Yes, the little girls appear to be testing if the statue is real.

Both girls approach the performer cautiously, touch him, and then react with surprise and laughter when he moves, running back to their guardians. This behavior indicates they were trying to determine if the living statue was actually a person."
0929-7,D
0933-0,"Based on the video and the provided explanations, the man in the costume did not light a fire. The loud sound heard at the moment the pie hits the woman's face is an added sound effect, likely used for comedic emphasis and to enhance the surprise of the prank. There is no visual evidence of any fire being lit in the video."
0933-1,"Based on the video and the provided analysis, **no fire was started**.

The person in the costume hit the woman with a creamy substance (like whipped cream or shaving cream) as a prank, and a loud sound effect was added to the video at the moment of impact. There is no visual evidence of fire, smoke, or burning."
0933-2,"**Yes**, the person in the costume uses a lighter to create a small flame and a clicking sound immediately before hitting the woman with the pie, indicating it was an intentional part of the prank sequence."
0933-3,"**No, the mascot did not light a fire.**

**Explanation:** The video shows the mascot surprising the woman by throwing whipped cream or a pie in her face. There is no fire involved in the prank."

0939-0,"**One person.**

**Explanation:** The video features a single actor portraying all the characters (the three boys and the dad) through editing."
0939-1,"**Answer:** 1

**Explanation:** Although the video shows four characters (three boys and a dad), the explanation clarifies that it is the same person playing all the roles through editing."
0939-2,"**Yes, it is true that only one person played all the roles in the video.**

**Explanation:** All the characters depicted (the three ""boys"" and the ""dad"") share the exact same physical appearance, indicating that a single person portrayed all the parts, likely using editing techniques to appear multiple times in the same scene."
0939-3,"**No**, there is only one person playing all four roles (the three boys and the dad) in the video. All the characters shown are visibly the same individual."
0939-7,B
0942-0,"The purpose is to demonstrate exceptional skill and showmanship by using a unique and difficult method to precisely crack the egg, allowing him to immediately create egg art on the griddle."
0942-1,"The man uses the side of the spatula to catch and break the egg primarily for **showmanship and to demonstrate skill**, which are common elements in teppanyaki cooking. This technique also allows for a **precise crack** and gives him **immediate control** over the egg contents, enabling him to efficiently begin drawing the heart shape on the grill as part of the performance."
0942-2,"**Yes**, the man is demonstrating a teppanyaki cooking technique. He skillfully catches the tossed egg on the edge of his spatula, breaking it cleanly onto the hot grill surface, which is a common performance element in teppanyaki."
0942-3,"**No.** The man is demonstrating advanced teppanyaki cooking skills and showmanship. He breaks the egg with precision not to highlight its fragility, but to use its contents artistically for drawing on the griddle as part of a culinary performance."
0942-7,C
0946-0,"Based on the video, **no foot was touched** after the chicken stopped moving. The interaction involved a person using their right hand to erase a line drawn on the ground near the chicken's head."
0946-1,"**No foot was touched.**

**Explanation:** The video shows the man holding the chicken's head and neck area down towards the ground while another person draws a line in the dirt in front of its beak. The chicken becomes still by focusing on the line (a phenomenon called tonic immobility), not because its foot was touched."
0946-2,"**No**, the man did not touch the chicken's left foot after it stopped moving. After the chicken became still and fixated on the line drawn in the dirt, the man's hands were not near its feet, and the subsequent interaction involved erasing the line, not touching the chicken's foot."
0946-3,"**No**, the man did not touch the chicken's right foot after it stopped moving. The video shows that after the chicken became still, the interaction focused entirely on its head and the line drawn in front of it, with no contact made with its feet."

0950-0,"**Answer:**

The ball is bouncing rapidly back and forth against the first tuning fork.

**Explanation:**

When the man strikes the second tuning fork (now also 260 Hz), the sound waves it produces travel to the first tuning fork. Because both forks have the same natural frequency (260 Hz), the first fork begins to vibrate strongly due to resonance. These strong vibrations cause the prongs of the first fork to repeatedly strike the nearby ping pong ball, making it bounce vigorously."
0950-1,"When the man hits the second tuning fork (240 Hz), the ping pong ball remains still next to the first tuning fork (260 Hz).

**Explanation:** The second tuning fork has a different frequency (240 Hz) than the first tuning fork (260 Hz). Because the frequencies do not match, the sound waves from the second fork do not cause the first fork to resonate (vibrate strongly). Therefore, the first fork does not vibrate enough to hit and move the ping pong ball."
0950-2,"**Yes, the ball remains still.**

**Explanation:** When the man strikes the tuning fork the second time, he is striking the one modified with a weight, which vibrates at 240 Hz. This frequency does not match the 260 Hz natural frequency of the first tuning fork next to the ping pong ball. Because the frequencies do not match, resonance does not occur, and the vibrations from the 240 Hz fork are not effectively transferred to the 260 Hz fork, leaving the ball unmoved."
0950-3,"**No**, the ball does not move upwards when the man strikes the second tuning fork.

**Explanation:** The second tuning fork has an added weight, changing its frequency to 240 Hz. This frequency does not match the natural frequency (260 Hz) of the first tuning fork next to the ball. Because the frequencies are different, resonance does not occur, and the vibrations from the second fork are not effectively transferred to the first fork, leaving the ball stationary."

0952-7,D
0956-0,"**Counter-clockwise.**

**Explanation:** When viewed from above (starting at 0:02), the man pushes the right, red-tipped end of the stick away from himself (upwards in the frame), causing it to rotate counter-clockwise around the central pivot point."
0956-1,"The red stick rotates **clockwise**.

**Explanation:** In the overhead view (starting around 0:02), the man pushes the stick, causing the red ends to move in a direction consistent with the hands on a clock. The right red end moves towards the bottom of the frame, then left, then top, and back right."
0956-2,"**No**, the red stick rotates in a **counter-clockwise** direction relative to the camera's overhead view (seen from 0:02 to 0:12)."
0956-3,"**No**, the red stick rotates in a **clockwise** direction relative to the camera's overhead perspective (seen from 0:02-0:12)."

0957-0,Tweezers were used to grab the substance forming at the interface between the two liquids. This substance was pulled upwards as a continuous string and collected by winding it onto the glass rod.
0957-1,"The process is **interfacial polymerization**, specifically known as the **Nylon Rope Trick**.

**Explanation:**

Two immiscible liquids, one aqueous (likely containing a diamine) and one organic (cyclohexane, likely containing a diacid chloride), were layered in the beaker. A chemical reaction (polymerization) occurs only at the interface where these two liquids meet, forming a thin film of nylon polymer. Tweezers were used to grasp this film, and as it was continuously pulled upwards and wound onto the glass rod, fresh reactants from each layer were exposed at the interface, allowing the nylon ""rope"" to be continuously synthesized and extracted."
0957-2,"Yes, the substance in the beaker ended up on the rod by being pulled out and wrapped around it. The video shows tweezers being used to grab the white substance forming at the interface between the two liquids. This substance is then continuously pulled out as a string and wound around a glass rod held above the beaker."
0957-3,"**No.**

The substance (nylon) formed from a chemical reaction at the interface between the two liquids. It was then pulled out of the beaker using tweezers and deliberately wrapped around the glass rod, which was held outside the beaker. The rod itself was not inserted into the beaker, so the substance did not adhere to it upon insertion."

0973-0,"The man in the gray hoodie (MrBeast) was injured **around the 0:41-0:42 mark** of the video.

**Explanation:** At this specific time, he visibly flinches and covers his head as the text ""Ow!"" appears on screen. This happens during the final segment where participants are throwing hard projectiles at hanging balloon clusters, and one appears to have ricocheted and struck him. His subsequent reactions and the visible cut on his forehead confirm the injury occurred at this moment."
0973-1,"The man in the gray hoodie (MrBeast) sustained the injury between **0:41** and **0:46**.

*   At **0:41**, he first exclaims ""Ow!"" and flinches.
*   At **0:42**, he reacts more strongly with another ""Ow!!"" and covers his head.
*   At **0:46**, he shouts ""Argh!"" while recoiling again.
*   The activity stops at **0:47**, and at **0:48**, he points to his forehead where blood is visible, confirming an injury occurred during the preceding seconds from a ricocheting projectile."
0973-2,"Yes, the man in the gray hoodie (MrBeast) was injured during the final balloon popping game.

**Explanation:** In the final segment, they threw hard objects (like screws or bolts) at the large balloon clusters. One of these objects ricocheted back and hit MrBeast on the forehead, causing a visible cut that was bleeding, as shown at the end of the video."
0973-3,"**No**, the man in the gray hoodie (MrBeast) did not get injured at the beginning of the video. The injury, a cut on his forehead, occurred near the end of the clip (around the 0:40 mark) when small objects they were throwing at balloon clusters bounced back and hit him."

0974-0,**At 00:02:** The video shows the person beginning to insert the orange straw into the top opening of the empty plastic bottle at the 2-second mark.
0974-1,"**0:02 - 0:03:**

*   **Explanation:** At the 0:02 mark, the hand is holding the straw directly above the bottle opening. By the 0:03 mark, the straw is fully inserted and resting inside the bottle. Therefore, the action of inserting the straw occurs within this one-second interval."
0974-2,"**Yes**, the video clearly shows the person preparing the bottle by drilling a hole, inserting the straw, and sealing it with hot glue *before* they perform the trick in the public setting."
0974-3,"No, the person did not put the straw into the bottle while sitting at the table. The video shows the straw being inserted and sealed into the bottle with a glue gun in the initial preparation phase, *before* the scene shifts to the person sitting at the table in McDonald's performing the trick."

0976-0,"**Answer:** The woman on the right answered correctly first.

**Explanation:** Although the man spoke first with an incorrect guess (""Roads""), the woman immediately followed with the correct answer (""Crossroads""), which was confirmed by the text overlay and the score changing in her favor."
0976-1,"**The man on the left.**

**Brief Explanation:** In the opening moments of the video (0:00-0:01), after the ""What is this?"" prompt appears, the man on the left is the first person to speak, offering the guess ""Roads."""
0976-2,"**Answer:** Yes, the person on the left (the man) was the first to answer in the first scene.
**Explanation:** In the first scene, the man says ""Roads"" immediately after the question is asked, before the woman says ""Crossroads""."
0976-3,"**Answer:** Yes, the woman on the right answered the first question correctly first.
*   **Explanation:** In the first scene (score 0-0), the rebus puzzle shows ""ROADS"" crossing ""ROADS"". The man on the left guesses ""Roads"", which is incorrect. The woman on the right then correctly guesses ""Crossroads"", and the score changes to 0-1 in her favor."
0976-7,D
0983-0,"The second person, a security guard, appears in the video to introduce conflict by confronting the artist. This interaction serves to demonstrate the effectiveness of the painted ladder illusion (trompe-l'œil) when the guard attempts to climb it, providing a comedic element and facilitating the artist's ""escape"" within the short narrative."
0983-1,The security guard appears because they observe the first person spray-painting the wall (unauthorized activity/perceived vandalism) and move to intervene and confront the artist as part of their job duties to protect the property. This interaction is also a planned element within the staged video to set up the final illusion.
0983-2,"Yes, the second person is a security guard investigating the graffiti artist. This is evident from the word ""SECURITY"" printed on the back of his jacket and his actions of shouting at the artist (""Hey you! You can't be doing that!"") and running towards them to intervene."
0983-3,"**Yes**, the second figure in the video, depicting a girl reaching upwards, is indeed a painted silhouette on the wall.

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows the artist creating a piece of street art. The figure of the girl is flat against the wall, rendered in black paint, and forms an integral part of the artwork alongside the painted ladder and heart balloon. It does not move independently and is visually distinct from the real people (the artist and the security guard) who appear in the scene."
0983-7,A
0985-0,"Yes, the money the woman reveals at the end of the video is the same money the man placed under the cup at the beginning.

**Explanation:** The video shows the woman subtly taking the rolled-up bill from under the cup while the man is distracted during the trick. When he lifts the cup the final time, the bill is gone from the table because she is holding it."
0985-1,"**No.**

The woman performs a sleight of hand, removing the original banknote from under the cup while the man lifts and lowers it. At the end of the video, she is clearly holding the original banknote in her hand, while a different (or seemingly duplicated) banknote is revealed under the cup."
0985-2,"**No**, the money did not come from the man's ear.

**Explanation:** At the very start of the video (0:00), the rolled-up money can be seen held between the fingers of the man's right hand. He uses sleight of hand to place the money on the table as he puts the cup down over it (around 0:02)."
0985-3,"No, the money did not stay in the cup because it was never placed inside the cup. The man placed the cup *over* the money on the table, shook the cup while it covered the money, and the money remained on the table surface underneath the cup."

**Explanation:** The image shows the word ""long"" positioned above the word ""due"", separated by a line. This visual arrangement represents the phrase ""long overdue""."
0995-2,"Yes, the answer to the eighth question in the video is 'long overdue'. The image shows the word ""long"" positioned over the word ""due"", visually representing the phrase, and both participants correctly identify it."
0995-3,"Yes, the answer to the puzzle featuring '2' above a crossed-out 'GOOD' is 'up to no good'.

**Explanation:** The puzzle shows the number '2' positioned above the word 'GOOD', which is crossed out within a box. This visually represents the phrase ""up to no good"". The male participant correctly solves this puzzle at approximately the 0:31 mark in the video. (Note: While this is the correct solution for that specific puzzle, it appears as the *fifth* puzzle in the video sequence, not the eighth)."

0996-0,"The third timer tool shown in the video is the **white circular device with hands**, representing a **mechanical clock concept** using a described **pendulum swing mechanism**. It is presented by the second inventor (""Mobohmad"") after the hourglass and the sundial."
0996-1,"The third timekeeping device featured is the **Paper Clock Face representing a Mechanical/Pendulum Clock concept.**

**Explanation:**
After the hourglass is dismissed and the sundial is presented by the first inventor (""Sumoses""), the second inventor (""Mobohmad"") presents his idea using a round white paper cutout with drawn hands. He explains this concept relies on a pendulum mechanism and ""hands"" to indicate time, making it the third distinct timekeeping device discussed with the Pharaoh."
0996-2,"**Yes**, the third timekeeping tool shown is described by its inventor (""Mobohmad"") as a concept that will use a ""pendulum swing mechanism"" to create constant movement in what he calls ""hands,"" which defines it as a pendulum clock."
0996-3,"Yes, the third timekeeping tool shown in the video is a sundial.

The character presenting it explicitly states, ""my concept uses the sun to cast a shadow,"" which is the defining characteristic of how a sundial functions. The object itself, a flat disc with a raised piece (gnomon) to cast the shadow, visually represents a sundial."

1002-1,"**Method:** He attempted to catch/intercept the stick using the baton held in his right hand.

**Explanation:** The video shows the fourth stick falling on the man's right side. He reacts by moving the baton in his right hand towards the stick's path in an attempt to hit or catch it, but the stick falls past the baton and lands on the floor mat. He did not successfully catch the fourth stick."
1002-2,"Yes, the man used his left foot to stop the fourth stick from hitting the ground after failing to catch it with the handles."

1009-0,"The man politely accepts the dismissal in both scenes. He immediately stops talking, physically withdraws (pulling back his pointing hand in the first scene, removing his hand from the visitor's shoulder in the second), smiles slightly, and adopts a more passive stance with his hands on his hips, appearing resigned but maintaining a professional and good-natured demeanor."
1009-1,"**Answer:**

In the first two scenes, the man proactively approaches the visitors and enthusiastically initiates conversation by sharing specific details about the artwork. When the visitors politely decline to engage further, he accepts their response, smiles, and maintains a friendly and professional demeanor, although perhaps slightly deflated.

**Explanation:**

He demonstrates enthusiasm by approaching and offering information (Observations 1, 2, 3, 7). His reaction to being turned down involves politeness, acceptance, and maintaining a friendly front (Observations 4, 5, 6, 8)."
1009-2,"**Answer:** No.

**Explanation:** In the first two scenes, although the man stops trying to engage the visitors about the art after they politely decline, he does not walk away from them. He remains standing nearby in both interactions."
1009-3,"**Yes**, the man appears enthusiastic and eager to engage.

**Explanation:** In both initial scenes, he proactively approaches the visitors, smiles, gestures towards the artwork they are viewing, and initiates conversation by offering specific, interesting details about the art or artist. This combination of actions clearly indicates his eagerness to interact and share his passion for the art."

1011-1,"The woman sprayed the man with the hose because she was shocked and disgusted when he pretended to bite into and eat the blue dish sponge she had been using. She reacted impulsively to his bizarre and unexpected action, unaware at that moment that he had swapped the real sponge for a lookalike Rice Krispies treat as a prank."
1011-2,"Yes, the woman sprayed the man with the hose because she reacted in shock when she saw him put the blue cleaning sponge into his mouth, leading her to believe he was consuming the sponge and potentially soap. Her immediate action of spraying him with water was an alarmed response to this perceived dangerous act."
1011-3,"**Yes.**

The man pranked the woman by pretending to bite into a blue dish sponge (which was actually an edible lookalike). Her immediate reaction was one of shock, followed by grabbing the sink's spray hose and spraying him with water in response to his prank."

1020-1,"When the baby sees their father, they look directly at him with a neutral, wide-eyed expression. The baby observes the father calmly but does not smile, laugh, reach out, or show the same level of excitement or engagement displayed towards the mother or big brother."
1020-2,"Yes, the baby shows a lack of excitement when seeing their dad.

**Explanation:** Compared to reaching eagerly for the mom and smiling/laughing happily at the big brother, the baby's reaction to the dad is relatively neutral and observant, lacking the same clear signs of enthusiasm."
1020-3,"**No, the baby does not react with excitement and joy when they see their dad.**

**Explanation:** In the video clip showing the interaction with the dad, the baby looks at him with a neutral, calm expression and does not smile, laugh, or reach out excitedly, unlike the clear joy and excitement shown when seeing the big brother."
1020-7,C
1023-0,"He appears slightly deflated but politely accepts her response, offering a brief, slightly awkward smile and nod before withdrawing his attempt to engage further."
1023-1,"He politely accepted her response, stopped his commentary about the artist, changed his posture by putting his hands behind his back, and maintained a pleasant demeanor."
1023-2,"No, the man did not show signs of frustration or disappointment after the first woman talked to him.

**Explanation:** His reaction involved a brief downward glance, a polite smile, and a nod, indicating professional acceptance of her statement that she was just looking, rather than annoyance."
1023-3,"No, the man did not seem happy or excited after the first woman spoke to him. His initial enthusiastic expression faded, and his body language became less engaged after she politely indicated she was just looking."
1023-7,A
1031-0,"The man is experiencing **shock, disbelief, and astonishment**.

**Explanation:** His wide eyes, open mouth, and gestures (like putting his hand to his mouth) clearly show he is stunned and cannot believe the incredibly high prices being bid for an artwork that is essentially a banana taped to a wall, especially while he holds a similar banana himself."
1031-1,"The man is experiencing a combination of **shock, disbelief, astonishment, and bewilderment**.

**Explanation:** His wide-eyed expressions, open mouth, and eventual hand-to-mouth gesture clearly show his shock and astonishment as he hears the auction bids for the banana artwork escalating rapidly into the millions. This reaction stems from his disbelief and bewilderment that an object identical to the simple banana he is casually eating could command such an astronomical price."
1031-2,"**Yes**, the man in the white shirt is clearly surprised and shocked by the banana auction.

**Explanation:** His facial expressions, including widening eyes and putting his hand to his mouth, along with his stunned look and hesitant clap after the final multi-million dollar bid, unmistakably convey his astonishment and disbelief at the escalating price of the banana artwork being auctioned."
1031-3,"**No, he does not appear calm and relaxed.** His wide eyes, slightly open mouth, and focused gaze suggest surprise or astonishment, likely reacting to the escalating auction prices for the banana artwork shown in the alternating scenes."

1044-0,"The person exhibits an **Automaticity/Habitual Response** combined with **Procedural Memory Activation**, likely triggered as a **Conditioned Response** to the specific game sounds.

**Explanation:** Upon being startled awake (**Startle Response**) by the intense game audio, the individual immediately accesses deeply ingrained motor skills and game knowledge (**Procedural Memory Activation**). The speed and lack of hesitation suggest a well-practiced, almost automatic reaction (**Automaticity/Habitual Response**) commonly associated with frequent gameplay, where the specific sounds act as a **Conditioned Stimulus** eliciting the immediate gameplay behavior."
1044-1,"**Bewildered and Startled.**

**Explanation:** The person was sound asleep and was abruptly woken by loud game sounds played directly into his ears via the headset placed on him. His wide eyes, sudden alertness, and the way he immediately grips the controller while looking around indicate he was startled from sleep and is confused and surprised by the sudden, intense situation he woke up in."
1044-2,"Yes, the person under the quilt is surprised and confused.

They are abruptly woken from sleep by loud video game sounds played through headphones placed on them while they slept. Their wide-eyed, startled reaction upon waking clearly indicates surprise at the sudden noise and confusion about the unexpected situation."
1044-3,"Yes, the person under the quilt becomes deeply engrossed in the video game.

**Explanation:** Although initially asleep (even holding the controller), the person instantly wakes up when the game audio starts and their friend begins playing. They immediately start playing with focus and concentration, demonstrating deep engrossment from the moment they wake up."

1045-0,"The person on the left hugs the person on the right primarily **to comfort and check on him** after startling him significantly with the prank. Given the younger boy's strong, shocked reaction (falling backward), the hug serves to **mitigate the scare**, reassure him it wasn't real, and possibly **steady him physically**. The timing also suggests it might partly be to **downplay the situation** for the adult who walks in immediately after, reinforcing that it was just a joke."
1045-1,"The person on the left embraces the individual in the tie-dye hoodie primarily to physically support him and prevent him from falling backward due to his extreme shock reaction to the prank reveal. The embrace also serves as an immediate way to comfort and reassure the younger boy that the apparent injury was fake and just a joke, helping to manage his intense reaction. He releases him once the initial shock and danger of falling seem to have passed and the situation changes with the mother's arrival."
1045-2,"**Yes.**

The older brother hugged the younger one immediately after he slumped over/fainted, precisely as their mother entered the room. This timing, combined with the older brother quickly telling his mother they were just ""having a great time,"" strongly indicates the hug was an attempt to conceal the younger brother's dramatic reaction to the prank and prevent their mother from discovering what had just happened."
1045-3,"**No**, the hug was not a celebration of a successful magic trick.

**Explanation:** The younger person reacted with shock and fear to the reveal of the pencil seemingly going through the older person's hand (a prank). The older person initiated the hug immediately following this startled reaction, likely to comfort him or show it wasn't real, rather than it being a mutual celebration."

1046-0,"The man in the black hat threw the person in the gray T-shirt into the pool as retaliation for being pushed into the pool himself just moments before. He likely mistook the person in the gray T-shirt for the original person who pushed him (who was wearing a black long-sleeved shirt and ran away), especially since the person in the gray T-shirt appeared from the same direction shortly after. The entire interaction appears to be a staged prank or skit."
1046-1,"Based on the video, the man in the black hat tossed the man in the gray T-shirt into the pool due to **Mistaken Identity**.

**Explanation:** The man in the black hat was initially pushed into the pool by a different individual (wearing a black long-sleeved shirt) who then ran away. The man in the hat got out and pursued the direction the original pusher went. He then encountered the man in the gray T-shirt emerging from that same area and likely mistook him for the person who had just pushed him in, leading to the retaliatory toss. The interaction appears playful, suggesting it might also be part of a prank or staged content."
1046-2,"**Yes.** The video shows the person initially wearing a black shirt pushing the person in the black hat into the pool. The person in the black hat then gets out, chases the first person (who has changed into a gray T-shirt), confronts them, and throws them into the pool in retaliation."
1046-3,"Yes, the reason the person in the black hat threw the person in the gray T-shirt into the pool was because it was a retaliatory prank.

**Explanation:** The video shows that the person (initially wearing a black shirt, later a gray T-shirt) first pushed the man in the black hat into the pool. The man in the hat then got out, chased the person down, and threw them into the pool in return, indicating a tit-for-tat prank exchange."

1049-0,"The person likely wants to express a **misguided attempt at humor or edginess for content creation**, possibly **provoking a reaction from the dog specifically for the video** and using the act as **engagement bait** due to its controversial nature."
1049-1,"Based on the video structure and the inclusion of Khaby Lame, the best answer is:

The intention is **to create comedic content by staging a skit where the person mimics a pointless action seen online (hitting the dog), primarily to set up the reaction from Khaby Lame, who comments on the absurdity.**

**Explanation:** The video shows someone watching an action on their phone and then replicating it (hitting the dog). This action appears nonsensical and serves as the setup for the final scene featuring Khaby Lame, whose presence indicates the preceding act is meant to be viewed as pointless or absurd, fitting the comedic format of his content."
1049-2,"Yes, the person gently tapped the dog with a slipper, which acted as a cue or command for the dog to get up and turn off the light switch."
1049-3,"**No**, the person was not expressing frustration or annoyance.

**Explanation:** The action shown in the video is a very light tap with the slipper, more like a gentle nudge to prompt the dog to move. The dog's calm reaction, simply getting up and walking away without signs of fear or pain, further indicates the tap was not forceful or driven by anger. It appears to be a functional cue within the context of the video's narrative."

1051-0,"Based on the video, the man in black bites his hand to express a combination of **playful embarrassment/awkwardness** at recreating the childhood photo as a large adult, and being **overwhelmed by affection and nostalgia** for the moment and his relationship with the elderly man. It's a physical way to manage the mix of amusement and strong positive emotions."
1051-1,"The man biting his hand appears to be expressing an overwhelming mix of affection, joy, and tenderness towards his grandfather. It's a physical manifestation of powerful positive emotions, suggesting the moment is deeply heartwarming and sentimental for him, almost too sweet or joyful to contain verbally."
1051-2,"Yes. The man in black brings his hand towards his mouth while sitting on the older man's lap, immediately before a childhood photo is shown where he, as a baby held by the same older man, has his hand in a similar position near his mouth. The sequence implies he is playfully recreating the pose from the photo."
1051-3,"**Yes.**

The man's gesture of bringing his hand to his mouth occurs during intense laughter while recreating a childhood pose with his elderly relative. This act is inherently nostalgic and sentimental. The laughter and accompanying gesture are a direct, physical reaction to the powerful mix of amusement, affection, and nostalgia evoked by this specific, meaningful moment."

1053-0,"Based on the video, the man in the black T-shirt appears to be expressing **playful annoyance or sarcastic politeness** by raising his hat/hood.

**Explanation:** Each time someone squeezes past him in the narrow airplane aisle, he lifts his hat/hood slightly, often smiling and glancing at his seatmate who also seems amused. This suggests he's making a lighthearted, perhaps slightly sarcastic, gesture acknowledging the repeated close encounters and the general inconvenience, turning it into a shared, humorous observation rather than genuine irritation."
1053-1,"Based on the video and the subsequent actions, the man in the black T-shirt lifts his hat to:

**Reveal his face and share a moment of amusement or disbelief (""Did you see that?"") with the man next to him regarding the person squeezing past, which is later revealed to be part of a joke.**"
1053-2,"Yes, the man in the black T-shirt is using his hoodie draped over the middle seat's headrest to make it appear occupied. His actions of adjusting it as people pass and then removing it when another passenger wants to sit there, along with the smiles exchanged with the man in the aisle seat, indicate a deliberate attempt to keep the seat free by creating the illusion it was taken."
1053-3,"**No**, the man in the black T-shirt is not raising a hat to greet someone. He does not appear to be wearing a separate hat, and his hand movement seems to be an adjustment of his hood or scarf while interacting with his seatmate, rather than a greeting gesture towards someone in the aisle."

1055-0,"The enlightenment value of this video is demonstrating the **immediate negative consequences of reckless actions and poor judgment, leading to harm and regret.**

**Explanation:** The video shows an individual performing a clearly dangerous act (putting a hand in a running blender) which results in immediate shock and apparent pain. The subsequent scenes show distress in another person affected by the action and the individual expressing regret (""what did I just do""), highlighting the direct link between the foolish decision and its negative outcomes."
1055-1,"The most significant takeaway is the critical importance of **Appliance Safety** and understanding the **Dangers of Misusing Objects**, particularly those with moving blades like blenders.

**Explanation:** The video graphically illustrates the severe and immediate danger of inserting a body part into a blender, highlighting that appliances must only be used as intended and with extreme caution. It serves as a stark reminder of the potential for serious injury when basic safety rules and common sense regarding hazardous household items are ignored."
1055-2,"No, the video does not have a high enlightenment value. The humor stems from an accident and potential injury during a prank, which provides shock value or superficial entertainment rather than deep insight, understanding, or intellectual growth typically associated with enlightenment."
1055-3,"**Yes, the enlightenment value is low.** The video primarily depicts a messy prank/accident involving ketchup and a blender, intended for shock or humor, rather than conveying knowledge, promoting critical thinking, or offering deeper understanding."
1055-7,D
1064-0,"The man is surprised because he expected a massive explosion from the large firework labeled ""BOMB,"" prompting him to run very far away. However, upon returning and bracing himself, the firework only produced a small, anticlimactic fizzle, making his extreme reaction and effort seem completely unnecessary and disproportionate to the actual outcome."
1064-1,"The man is surprised because after running a long distance away for safety, he returned too soon, misjudging the fuse's burn time. He finds himself dangerously close to the very large firework just as the fuse is about to run out, realizing the massive explosion is imminent."
1064-2,"**Yes**, the man is surprised because the video edits show him running a long distance away from the lit firework, through various locations, only to suddenly reappear right next to it just before it explodes. This impossible return after his escape attempt is the cause of his shocked reaction."
1064-3,"No, the man is not surprised that the firework exploded, as he lit the fuse himself and initially ran away expecting it to detonate. His surprise stems from the fact that it exploded *after* he had run back towards it, catching him unexpectedly close to the blast."
1064-7,C
1075-0,"The video splices together shots of Peter Parker and Spider-Man primarily **to show his dual identity and highlight the internal conflict and sacrifices** associated with it. It contrasts Peter's mundane struggles, personal desires (like his feelings for MJ), and vulnerability with the immense responsibility, isolation, and burden he carries as Spider-Man, visually representing the theme of ""Am I not supposed to have what I want? What I need?""."
1075-1,"The purpose of splicing together shots of Peter Parker and Spider-Man is to highlight the **duality** of his existence and the **internal conflict** that arises from it. It contrasts Peter's relatable, often difficult, personal life, desires, and vulnerabilities with the immense **burden, responsibility, and sacrifice** inherent in being Spider-Man. This juxtaposition serves to **humanize** the hero, emphasize the **personal cost** of his secret identity, and create **emotional resonance** with his struggle to balance both worlds."
1075-2,"**Yes**, the video splices shots of Peter Parker experiencing everyday struggles, social awkwardness, and longing with scenes depicting the isolated and burdened nature of his Spider-Man identity. This contrast effectively highlights the personal cost of his heroism and how his responsibilities as Spider-Man exclude him from the ordinary life and connections he desires."
1075-3,"Yes, the video splices together shots of Peter Parker (the ordinary person) and Spider-Man because, within the context of the source material (the Spider-Man films these clips are from), they are indeed the same character. The editing illustrates this established dual identity rather than merely suggesting it."
1075-7,D
1080-0,"The man peels the carrot with a standard vegetable peeler and seems amazed (or rather, exasperated) to highlight the unnecessary complexity and effort involved in the ""life hack"" of modifying a spoon for the same task. His reaction emphasizes that a simple, efficient, and readily available tool (the peeler) already exists, making the elaborate spoon modification completely redundant and absurd. He's essentially questioning why someone would go through so much trouble when a straightforward solution is obvious."
1080-1,"The man reacts with exasperation to highlight the **unnecessary complexity and pointlessness** of modifying a spoon with tools simply to peel a carrot. He then **demonstrates the obvious, efficient, and common-sense solution** – using a standard vegetable peeler – thereby **satirizing the overly complicated ""life hack""** presented earlier."
1080-2,"Yes. The man is reacting to the overly complicated first method (modifying a spoon with a grinder to peel a carrot) by demonstrating the simple, standard method using a regular vegetable peeler. His signature silent reaction expresses exasperation and disbelief at the unnecessary complexity shown previously."
1080-3,"**No.** The man (Khaby Lame) was not surprised that the spoon could be made into a peeler. His reaction, typical of his content, expresses exasperation at the overly complicated and unnecessary effort involved in modifying the spoon when a simple, standard vegetable peeler already exists and works efficiently, which he then demonstrates."
1080-7,C
1081-0,"The little green bricks represent **mouthwash**.

**Explanation:** In the video, the green bricks are poured into the mimic's mouth, the mouth is closed and shaken to simulate swishing, and then the bricks are poured out (""spat"") into a container, mimicking the exact steps of using mouthwash in an oral hygiene routine."
1081-1,"The small green bricks represent mouthwash. They are poured into the LEGO mimic's mouth, swished around (by shaking the mimic), and then poured out to simulate the action of rinsing with mouthwash as part of the demonstrated oral hygiene routine."
1081-2,"**Yes**, the small green bricks represent mouthwash. The narrator explicitly states ""Next, we use some mouthwash"" immediately before pouring the green bricks into the mimic's mouth, shaking it to simulate swishing, and then emptying them out to simulate spitting."
1081-3,"No, the little green bricks in the video do not represent grass. They represent mouthwash. In the video, they are poured into the LEGO mimic's mouth, swished around, and then spat out as part of a demonstrated oral hygiene routine, mimicking the use of mouthwash."
1081-7,C
1087-0,"Based on the optical illusion presented:

The circle on the left **appears to move in the direction indicated by the internal arrow**, which changes throughout the video (right, left, down, up, etc.). However, **it is not actually moving**; the perceived motion is an optical illusion."
1087-1,"The perceived movement direction of the circle on the left is constantly **changing/rotating**.

**Explanation:** Due to an optical illusion, the circle appears to move in whichever direction the arrow inside it is pointing at any given moment (right, down, left, up, etc.), even though the circle itself is stationary."
1087-2,"**True.**

The left circle itself is stationary. The perception of movement is an optical illusion created by the changing direction of the internal arrow, which tricks your brain into perceiving motion in the static ring. Covering the arrow breaks this illusion, revealing the circle isn't actually moving."
1087-3,"**No, the left circle does not actually move.**

**Explanation:** The perception of movement in the direction indicated by the arrow is a compelling optical illusion. This effect is created by the shifting color patterns within the ring, which tricks your brain into seeing motion even though the circle itself remains stationary."
1087-7,C
1090-0,"Based on the sheep's reaction (hesitating and walking around the drawing rather than over it), the painting likely looks like **a physical barrier with holes or gaps in the road beneath it.**

*   **Explanation:** The sheep perceive the 3D illusion not as flat chalk but as a real change in the terrain. The drawn ""bridge"" appears as a solid obstacle they cannot easily walk over, and the shaded areas underneath look like dangerous holes, gaps, or a drop-off they must avoid stepping into. This combination compels them to navigate around the sides."
1090-1,"Based on the video, the sheep appear to perceive the painting on the ground as **a physical barrier or obstacle**.

**Explanation:** The sheep hesitate when they reach the drawing and actively choose to walk around it on the side of the road rather than stepping onto the painted area. This behavior indicates they see the 3D illusion not as flat lines, but as a solid, impassable structure or potentially a dangerous hole/drop-off that blocks their direct path."
1090-2,"**Yes**, the painting on the ground appears to look like a broken bridge or a significant obstacle to the sheep.

**Explanation:** The sheep hesitate when they reach the drawing, bunch up, and then actively choose to walk around the painted area on the sides of the path rather than crossing over it. This avoidance behavior strongly suggests they perceive the optical illusion as a real gap, hole, or impassable barrier."
1090-3,"**Answer:** No, it's unlikely the sheep perceive the drawing specifically as a large puddle.

**Explanation:** The drawing creates a strong optical illusion of depth and structure, appearing more like a hole, a ditch, or a physical barrier across the road rather than a flat surface of water. The sheep react by stopping and going around it, indicating they perceive it as an obstacle, a hazard, or a confusing disruption on their path, triggering their natural avoidance behavior. While they avoid it, the visual cues suggest they are reacting to the perceived depth or solidity, not necessarily to the appearance of water."
1090-7,B
1091-0,"**Answer:** 4 people.

**Explanation:** Based on dual perception, there are three distinct figures painted in the scene (a woman reading, a man standing, a figure walking in the distance) and one large face of an old man formed by the optical illusion created by the arrangement of these figures and the surrounding elements like the archway."
1091-1,"**Answer:** Three individuals are visible, forming one larger face.

*   **Description:** A woman with reddish-blonde hair in a white dress sits on a bench reading; behind her stands an older man with a grey beard in a dark hooded robe holding a book; further in the background, a figure in a white dress walks up a path. These three figures, along with the surrounding landscape and archway, combine to create the optical illusion of the face of an old man with a long white beard.
*   **Explanation:** This answer acknowledges both the literally depicted figures within the scene and the well-known optical illusion they collectively form."
1091-2,"Yes, there are three people visible in the image. A woman is sitting on a bench reading a book, and a man in dark clothing is standing behind her. However, the third person, who is wearing lighter clothing (possibly pinkish/white) and a head covering, is located further in the background near a building, not standing directly next to the man in dark clothing."
1091-3,"**No, this is not true.**

**Explanation:** The painting clearly depicts three people: a woman sitting on the bench reading, a man standing behind her, and a third figure standing further back on the path near the building in the background."
1091-7,B
1095-0,"The person in the upper left corner throws a small stone into the bucket to create a splash.

**Explanation:** This splash is a practical visual effect. In the ""Final Result"" shot, which is an edited composite, this real splash is timed to coincide with the digitally miniaturized person appearing to jump into the bucket, simulating the impact and making the illusion more convincing."
1095-1,"The person threw the stone into the bucket to create the splash effect seen in the ""Final Result"". This splash was filmed and then combined with footage of the other person jumping through video editing to create the illusion that the tiny person caused the splash by jumping into the bucket."
1095-2,"**Yes.** Clip 1 clearly shows the person dropping a stone into the blue bucket, causing a splash. This action was filmed specifically to generate the splash effect, which was then edited together with the footage of the other person jumping/posing (Clips 2 & 3) to create the final composite visual trick."
1095-3,"**No.**

The appearance of the person inside the bucket is a result of video editing (likely cutting between different shots). The person throwing the stone in Clip 1 is likely involved in setting up or filming the scene, and their action does not magically cause the other person to appear in the bucket in the ""Final Result""."
1095-7,C
1101-0,"The man gradually submerged the piece of paper **to create a specific visual effect for a photograph or video.**

**Explanation:** By placing the cutout at the water's surface, it creates the illusion that the deity (Durga) is standing on or emerging from the river. This integrates the subject into the watery environment for the desired composition and allows for a low-angle perspective, making the final shot more visually interesting and dramatic."
1101-1,"The man slowly dipped the piece of paper into the water primarily **to create the illusion of the cutout floating or standing directly on the water's surface** for the photo/video being taken.

**Explanation:**

This slow, careful placement allows precise positioning right at the waterline. This achieves the desired visual effect seen in the final shots, where the goddess figure appears integrated with the river environment as if standing upon it. It also facilitates getting a low-angle shot that makes the small cutout appear more prominent within the composition."
1101-2,"**Answer:** No.
**Explanation:** The video shows the man planting the stick, which holds the paper cutout, into the riverbed. The paper cutout itself remains above the water surface during this setup. The final shot shows the cutout standing stably *in* the water, not dynamically emerging *from* it."
1101-3,"No, the purpose was not to make the paper completely wet.

**Explanation:** The video shows only the base of the paper cutout (attached to a stick) being slowly submerged. This action appears primarily aimed at **positioning and anchoring the cutout** so it stands upright in the water, creating the **visual effect** of the deity floating or standing on the river surface for a **photograph or video**. Making only the base wet is necessary for this specific setup, not for wetting the entire object."
1101-7,A
1111-0,"**Answer:** The woman sitting second from the left, wearing the dark red/maroon saree, started to stand up or leaned forward significantly around the 0:03-0:04 mark but then immediately sat back down on the wall instead of joining the others who stood up."
1111-1,"**The woman second from the left, wearing the maroon/dark red saree.**

**Explanation:** Around the 0:03 mark, as the dancer stands up, this woman begins to push herself up off the wall but quickly sits back down, while the two women to her right stand up fully."
1111-2,"Yes. The woman in the brown and red sari stands up briefly around the 0:02-0:03 mark but immediately sits back down by 0:04, while the dancer begins to interact with the other women who remained standing."
1111-3,"**No**, the man in the white shirt was already seated at the beginning of the video and remained seated throughout the entire clip. He never stood up."
1111-7,D
1112-0,"**Answer:** The man in the blue shirt took the firework.

**Explanation:** The video includes a flashback replay (around 0:15) that explicitly shows the man in the blue shirt grabbing the firework from under the bucket as both men run away to hide, leaving only the lighter behind. This is further confirmed when an explosion occurs where the man in the blue shirt hid, resulting in him being covered in soot."
1112-1,"Based on the video and the provided answers:

The **man in the blue shirt** picked up the firework.

**Explanation:** A brief flashback in the video clearly shows the man in the blue shirt running away holding the firework, while the man in the pink shirt runs without it. Consequently, the man in the pink shirt later finds only the lighter under the bucket."
1112-2,"Yes, the person in the blue shirt took the firework instead of the lighter. This is shown in a flashback where he grabs the firework as they run away, and confirmed when his friend finds only the lighter left under the bucket before the explosion occurs inside the building the man in blue entered."
1112-3,"**No.** The video includes a flashback (around 0:15) that clearly shows the man in the *blue* shirt running away while holding the red firework. The man in the white shirt was left with only the lighter under the bucket, which he discovered when he went back to check."
1112-7,A
1117-0,"**Answer:** The man in the blue shirt failed the challenge.
**Explanation:** He was the last person to add water to the glass, and his addition caused the surface tension to break, making the water overflow."
1117-1,"**Answer:** The man in the blue shirt lost the challenge.

**Explanation:** He was the participant whose turn it was when the water's surface tension broke, causing the water to spill over the rim of the glass (around 0:49-0:50 in the video). Although previous participants filled the glass significantly, his action was the direct cause of the overflow."
1117-2,"Yes, the person in the blue shirt failed the challenge because the water overflowed when the final drop fell during their turn."
1117-3,"**No**, the person in the **blue shirt** made the water overflow and failed the challenge. The overflow occurs during the blue shirt person's final turn adding drops (around 0:49)."
1117-7,D
1119-0,**Answer:** The light-colored bowl (not iron) is knocked out of the person in red's hands and flies into the air as he reacts and falls backward off the couch around the 0:04-0:05 mark.
1119-1,"The bowl is on the floor next to the person in red, between him and the couch, amidst spilled popcorn."
1119-2,"**Yes.** When the person in red reacts to the oversized phone screen appearing to hit them, they fall backward off the couch, dropping the metal popcorn bowl. The bowl lands on the floor in the area visually covered by the large phone screen effect."
1119-3,"**No**, the bowl is not on his lap when he reacts. His startled reaction causes him to throw the bowl and popcorn into the air as he falls backward off the couch."
1119-7,C
1121-0,"**Cloud Symbol:** The filament light bulb is located in the upper left area of the control panel, directly above the red segment which features white cloud symbols."
1121-1,"The symbol nearest to the filament light bulb on the control panel is the **white clouds symbol on the red/orange background**. This symbol is located in the top-left section of the panel, directly below and slightly to the right of the bulb's position."
1121-2,"Yes, the symbol closest to the filament light bulb on the control panel is three white clouds on a red background."
1121-3,"**No**, the symbol closest to the filament light bulb on the control panel depicts white clouds on an orange/red background, not the sun. The yellow sun symbol is located two sections further to the right."
1121-7,A
1122-0,"**Answer:** At the end of the video, the little man in overalls with the white bag is inside the vacuum cleaner system.

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows the man being sucked upwards into the vacuum cleaner hose just before the scene cuts away. This indicates he has been removed from the miniature world under the couch and is now within the vacuum cleaner's hose or collection area (bag/canister)."
1122-1,"**Answer:** At the conclusion of the video, the little man in overalls ends up inside the vacuum cleaner.

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows the miniature man being sucked directly into the vacuum cleaner's hose just before the scene cuts back to the person operating the vacuum."
1122-2,"**Yes**, the little man in overalls ends up inside the vacuum cleaner.

**Explanation:** The video shows the vacuum nozzle descending towards the miniature man as he screams. Immediately after, the scene cuts back to the real world, and a faint scream is heard coming from the vacuum cleaner's hose, strongly implying he was vacuumed up."
1122-3,"**No**, the little man is not found inside the janitor's closet at the end of the video. He emerges from the closet near the beginning of the fantasy sequence under the couch, encounters multiplying dust bunnies, and is then seen being sucked up by the vacuum cleaner nozzle just before the video cuts back to the man vacuuming in the real world."
1122-7,A
1124-0,"**Answer:** The egg's final location depends on which action is considered: inside the bottle (first clip) or knocked away (second clip).

**Explanation:** The video demonstrates two different scenarios. In the first part, the bottle is struck sideways, causing the egg to fall straight down into the bottle due to inertia. In the second part, the hand strikes the egg (or very close to it) directly, knocking it sideways off the bottle."
1124-1,"The egg falls directly into the water bottle.

**Explanation:** The performer strikes the bottle horizontally with a quick force. This rapid removal of support causes the bottle to move sideways. Due to inertia, the egg resists this horizontal motion and remains momentarily suspended in the air above the bottle's original position. Gravity then pulls the egg straight down, causing it to fall neatly into the opening of the bottle."
1124-2,"Yes, the egg does not go into the bottle. It's a sleight-of-hand trick where the performer quickly removes the egg with their fingers and conceals it in their hand (potentially holding it behind the bottle momentarily) at the exact moment they make the downward slapping motion for misdirection."
1124-3,"Yes, the egg ended up inside the water bottle. The performer applied a quick, sharp downward force to the egg, causing it to fall straight down into the bottle's opening due to inertia and gravity."
1124-7,A
1127-0,"**Answer:** From the camera's perspective, the shooter is in the midground, slightly right of the frame's center, facing away from the camera. The target basket is positioned further away from the camera (deeper in the scene) than the shooter, also slightly right of the center, directly in the shooter's line of sight."
1127-1,"**Answer:** The shooter is positioned on the basketball court floor in the mid-ground, slightly left-of-center, while the target basket is elevated and further away in the background, towards the upper right of the frame.

**Explanation:** This description accurately captures the relative positions from the camera's perspective in the indoor gym segment. The shooter is closer and lower, while the hoop is farther and higher, with specific placement noted within the camera's view (mid-ground/left-of-center for shooter, background/upper-right for basket)."
1127-2,"**No**, the target basket is located in front of the man. He is facing towards it as he prepares to shoot."
1127-3,"**No**, the target basket (the smaller one attached to the tree) is positioned to the shooter's left, not directly in front of him. He has to aim slightly across his body to shoot at it."
1127-7,B
1130-0,"**Answer:** Blue ball.
**Explanation:** The video demonstrates that when the man taps the table, the blue ball consistently oscillates with a significantly larger amplitude compared to the green and red balls, indicating it is resonating with the frequency of the taps."
1130-1,"**Answer:** The red ball showed the most movement.

**Explanation:** During the time the man swung his arm, the red ball was actively swinging back and forth in a pendulum motion, covering a significant distance, while the blue and green balls remained stationary."
1130-2,"**No**, the red ball did not move significantly when the old man swung his arm with the largest magnitude.

**Explanation:** The video shows the red ball is mounted on a separate, independent stand and is not mechanically linked to the stand holding the blue and green balls, which the man is moving. Therefore, the motion imparted by the man primarily affects the blue and green balls, leaving the red ball relatively stationary."
1130-3,"Yes, the blue ball moved significantly. The video shows that the magnitude of the blue ball's swing was directly correlated with the magnitude of the older man's arm swing; his largest actions produced the blue ball's largest and most significant movement."
1130-7,B
1134-0,"The ball traveled in an arc, hit the backboard squarely, and bounced back towards the thrower without touching the rim or net."
1134-1,"**Upwards and Forwards, initiating a High Arching Path:** At the moment of release (around 0:12), the ball travels both vertically upwards and horizontally forwards away from the shooter, starting a high arc aimed towards the backboard/hoop area."
1134-2,"**No, the ball did not bounce back to the person.**

After hitting the front of the rim in the last scene, the ball bounced off to the side (viewer's left), away from the person who threw it."
1134-3,"**No**, the ball did not descend directly towards the basketball hoop. Its descent path was clearly aimed well to the left of the hoop."
1134-7,B
1137-0,"**Downwards / Towards the ground.**

**Explanation:** When the woman is upside down (around the 4-5 second mark), the man holding her legs has also flipped himself upside down into a handstand-like position. Therefore, his head is pointing towards the ground/grass."
1137-1,"**Upwards / Towards the woman he is supporting.**

**Explanation:** When the woman is upside down, the man in white has his head tilted back, and his gaze is directed upwards towards the woman he is lifting and holding above him."
1137-2,"**No**, when the woman is upside down, the man is also upside down performing a handstand on her back/shoulders. Therefore, his head is facing down towards the ground, not up and forward at the camera."
1137-3,"**Yes.** When the woman is bent over in an upside-down position, the man jumps onto her back and is also upside down, so his head is facing downward towards the ground."
1137-7,B
1145-0,"**12 hours**

**Explanation:** In the ""adult"" section, the woman first checks her phone at 0:18, and the time displayed is 8:00. She checks it again at 0:28, and the time displayed is 20:00. The difference between 8:00 and 20:00 is 12 hours."
1145-1,"The time gap is **12 hours**.

**Explanation:** In the ""How time feels as an adult"" segment, the woman first checks her phone, which displays **8:00**. Later, she checks it again, and it displays **20:00**. The difference between 20:00 and 8:00 is 12 hours."
1145-2,"Yes, the woman checks her phone 12 hours apart as an adult. The first time she checks it in the adult segment, the time is 8:00, and the second time, it is 20:00 (which is 8:00 PM), indicating a 12-hour difference."
1145-3,"**Yes.**

**Explanation:** In the segment titled ""How time feels as an adult,"" the video shows the woman checking her phone at approximately the 18-second mark (displaying 8:00) and again at the 28-second mark (displaying 20:00). These two checks occur within about 10 seconds of video time."
1145-7,D
1159-0,"The fifth item shown is **Highlighters**, and the seventh item shown is **Eraser**."
1159-1,"Based on the video sequence:

*   **Fifth Item:** Highlighters
*   **Seventh Item:** Eraser"
1159-2,"Yes, the fifth item shown in the video is highlighters, and the seventh item is erasers. The video displays the items sequentially, confirming this order."
1159-3,"No, that is incorrect. The fifth item shown in the video is Highlighters, and the seventh item is an Eraser."
1159-7,A
1160-0,"The fourth item shown in the video is a **chunky, heavy, black rectangular metal slider** with an engraved design.

**Explanation:** This item appears at the 0:15 mark. The narrator specifically describes it as a ""chunky and heavy piece of metal that catches the most attention,"" and the visuals show a black, rectangular object being slid apart, consistent with a magnetic slider fidget toy."
1160-1,"**Answer:** The fourth toy displayed is a chunky, heavy, black rectangular metal slider with an engraved design on its surface.

**Explanation:** This toy appears in the video sequence around the 0:15 mark, immediately following the multi-tool style fidget (Toy 3). The video's accompanying text specifically describes it as ""a chunky and heavy piece of metal that catches the most attention"" while it is being shown."
1160-2,"Yes, the fourth item is a metal fidget slider. Its resemblance to a mahjong tile stems from its chunky, rectangular block shape, although the material and engraved design are different from traditional tiles."
1160-3,"**No, the fourth item is not the small black pill-shaped fidget toy.**

**Explanation:** The fourth item shown in the video (around 0:15) is a chunky, heavy, black rectangular metal slider. The small black pill-shaped toy was the second item featured (around 0:04)."
1160-7,C
1161-0,"**Answer:** Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Red, Orange.

*   **Explanation:** The video shows the light strip illuminating sequentially in these distinct colors: starting with yellow, transitioning to green, then blue, followed by purple, then red, and finally settling on orange before the clip zooms in."
1161-1,"The sequence of colors shown by the light strip is: **Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Red, Orange**.

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows the light strip cycling through these distinct colors in this specific order after it is initially activated."
1161-2,"**Yes**, the video confirms the light strip displays the colors yellow, green, cyan, blue, purple, red, and orange in the order specified."
1161-3,"**Yes, the color order displayed by the long strip of light on the object in the video is yellow, green, blue, purple, and red.**

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows the light strip cycling through these colors consecutively in the exact order listed: starting with yellow, then changing to green, then blue, then purple, and finally red before transitioning to an orange/amber color."
1161-7,A
1162-0,"The order of the menu options browsed is: **Calendar, Clock, Notes, Calculator, Settings.**

**Explanation:** The video shows the user navigating downwards through the menu list, highlighting each of these options in sequence starting from Calendar and ending with Settings."
1162-1,"**Answer:** Menu Scroll (Calendar to Settings) -> Notes Access -> Messages Access

**Explanation:** The video first shows the user entering the main menu and scrolling down through the options: Calendar, Clock, Notes, Calculator, and Settings without selecting any. Immediately after, the user presses a dedicated shortcut button (book icon, likely Notes or Contacts) to enter text, and then presses another shortcut button (speech bubble icon, likely Messages). This sequence accurately reflects both the menu list scrolling and the subsequent function access via shortcuts shown."
1162-2,"**Answer:** No, the person does not end the browsing at Calculator.

**Explanation:** The video shows the user scrolling through the menu options starting with ""Calendar"", then moving to ""Clock"", ""Notes"", and ""Calculator"". However, the scrolling continues past ""Calculator"" to highlight the ""Settings"" option before the view changes."
1162-3,"Yes, the video shows the person scrolling through a menu between 0:05 and 0:08, where ""Settings"" is clearly listed as one of the options along with Calendar, Clock, Notes, and Calculator."

1168-0,"The man in the red hat fell because he stepped onto a section of a 3D chalk artwork that created a convincing optical illusion of a hole or cliff edge. This surface was actually a weak covering over a real, hidden hole, which broke under his weight when he stepped on it, causing him to fall in."
1168-1,"The man in the red hat stepped onto the 3D chalk artwork, and his apparent fall into the hole was a visual illusion created using digital effects (VFX/CGI) added in post-production. There was no actual hole, and the fall did not physically happen; it was simulated digitally."
1168-2,"Yes, the man's fall into the hole is due to a combination of the optical illusion created by the 3D artwork on the ground and video editing/visual effects used to make him appear to fall into it. The artwork itself is flat, but designed to look like a hole from a certain perspective (optical illusion), and the falling action is added digitally."
1168-3,"**No, the man did not fall into an actual hole.**

The ""hole"" is a 3D street painting designed to create an optical illusion on a flat surface. His apparent fall is simulated, likely through acting or video editing, as part of an interaction with the artwork, not a genuine accident caused by being deceived. The woman's subsequent actions near the painted area further confirm the ground is solid."

1169-0,"Based on the video, the guy in the black and white clothes wasn't actually kicked to pieces.

**Explanation:** This was a staged visual illusion or magic trick. The person was wearing the referee costume over a black t-shirt and shorts. When the soccer ball approached, they quickly shed the outer costume and likely released hidden extra soccer balls simultaneously, creating the effect of exploding upon impact. It was a pre-planned stunt using a quick costume change and misdirection."
1169-1,"The effect was most likely achieved through **video editing (VFX/CGI) combined with clever editing/compositing.**

**Explanation:** The instantaneous disappearance of the referee, the simultaneous appearance of multiple flying soccer balls and clothes, and the seamless reveal of the second person strongly suggest digital manipulation was used to remove the original person and composite the different elements (falling clothes, extra balls, second person) into the final shot. While a practical breakaway costume might be part of it, the overall effect points heavily towards post-production techniques."
1169-2,"Yes, the effect of the man seemingly exploding into clothes and balls when kicked is achieved through video editing. It's a visual trick, as the sudden disappearance of the person and the appearance of clothes and multiple balls in his place is physically impossible and indicates digital manipulation or clever cutting."
1169-3,"Yes, the man in black and white clothes was a mannequin or prop.

**Explanation:** When the soccer ball hits him, the figure instantly disintegrates into separate pieces of clothing (shirt, pants, hat, shoes) and multiple soccer balls. This is physically impossible for a real human being, confirming it was a prop or mannequin used for a visual effect."
1169-7,A
1170-0,"The containers disappeared through **video editing and visual effects (VFX)**.

**Explanation:** The sequence where the containers vanish (especially the Tetris-like row clearing and the final collapse) is not physically possible and was created digitally in post-production using software to manipulate the video footage and remove the container elements."
1170-1,"The containers vanished due to **video editing/special effects (VFX) or computer-generated imagery (CGI)**. This effect was added in post-production to mimic the line-clearing mechanic from the game Tetris, making the video a creative piece or parody."
1170-2,"Yes, the containers disappear because they were part of a Tetris-like game created using post-production visual effects (VFX) or computer-generated imagery (CGI). The way the rows vanish when completed is physically impossible for real containers and cranes, clearly indicating digital manipulation after filming to mimic the gameplay of Tetris."
1170-3,"**Yes**, the containers fell off the ship because they were stacked in an unstable, Tetris-like formation that lacked structural integrity, causing the stack to collapse."
1170-7,C
1173-0,"Based on the video and the provided explanations, here is the best answer:

The person disappeared due to **video editing**, likely as part of a **staged skit**. A **cut** was strategically placed during the moment the liquid splashed, hiding the transition between the footage showing the person and the subsequent footage where they are absent."
1173-1,"The person vanished due to **video editing, likely a jump cut.**

**Explanation:** The large splash of liquid from the cups erupting upwards was timed perfectly to obscure the view for a fraction of a second, allowing the editor to cut from the scene with the person present to a scene immediately after where the person is gone, making it appear as though they vanished instantly during the chaos."
1173-2,"Yes, the person disappears due to post-production editing.

**Explanation:** The transition from the person being present during the splash to completely absent immediately after is instantaneous and physically impossible. This effect is achieved by cutting from a shot with the actor to a shot of the empty, messy seat, with the cut hidden by the visual chaos of the splashing drinks."
1173-3,"**No**, the person did not disappear because the car made a sudden stop or sharp turn. While the car's movement caused the drinks to spill, the person's subsequent absence is a result of video editing used for effect, not a physical consequence of the car's action."
1173-7,D
1175-0,"The bear is a Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI) model that is digitally animated to stand, roar, and walk. This animated CGI bear is then composited (integrated) into the live-action footage using Visual Effects (VFX) techniques in post-production, making it appear as if the chalk drawing came to life."
1175-1,"The technique used is a combination of **CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery)** and **Compositing**.

**Explanation:** A digital 3D model of the polar bear was created using CGI. This model was then animated to make it move, roar, and walk. Finally, this CGI animation was digitally layered (composited) onto the original live-action video footage of the street artist and the surroundings, making it appear as though the chalk drawing came to life within the scene. A transition effect was likely used to blend the initial chalk drawing into the CGI bear smoothly."
1175-2,"**Yes, the bear on the ground is made to appear to move through clever editing between a 3D painting and a real or CGI bear.**

**Brief Explanation:** The video initially shows an artist creating a 3D chalk drawing of a polar bear on the pavement. At the moment the woman says ""Say cheese"" (around 0:11), video editing techniques (like compositing or a simple cut) are used to seamlessly replace the static drawing with footage of an actual moving polar bear (which could be real or CGI), creating the illusion that the drawing came to life."
1175-3,"**No, the bear is not mechanical.**

**Explanation:** The bear is created using CGI/visual effects. It materializes directly out of the chalk drawing on the pavement, which is impossible for a physical mechanical object."
1175-7,B
1176-0,"The plant appeared to grow larger through a combination of **video editing (a cut)** and a **location change**.

**Explanation:** When the man steps through the doorway, the video cuts to a completely different, much larger location (likely a conservatory or botanical garden) where a pre-existing giant prop plant is positioned. The doorway acts as a transition point to hide the cut between the two separate filming locations and props. Visual effects are also used later when the giant plant appears to attack the man."
1176-1,"The plant appears larger due to **editing and visual effects (VFX/CGI)**.

**Explanation:** The video uses a clever cut (editing) as the man enters the ""greenhouse."" The scene transitions from the small exterior location with a normal-sized plant to a completely different, much larger interior location (likely a botanical garden or studio). In this second location, a giant version of the plant (either a physical prop or, more likely, a digital creation using VFX/CGI) is shown, creating the illusion of rapid, impossible growth."
1176-2,"Yes, the plant in the man's hand appeared larger due to a visual effect created by post-production video editing techniques.

The transition from the exterior shot, showing a small greenhouse and a normal-sized plant, to the interior shot, revealing a vastly larger space and an enormous plant, is physically impossible and indicates the use of visual effects to manipulate the scale of the plant and the environment."
1176-3,"**No**, the plant did not grow larger because of a change in perspective. The video uses editing or special effects to create this illusion. As the man passes through the doorway, the scene cuts or transitions to show him next to a much larger prop or digitally created plant, making it seem like the original plant grew instantaneously."
1176-7,B
1177-0,"The man on the dock used a lookalike (a double) who was already hidden on the yellow boat. When the first man jumped into the water near the dock, the double simultaneously stood up on the boat, creating the illusion of teleportation."
1177-1,"The technique used is a **Jump Cut** combined with **Misdirection** and likely a **Substitution Splice (Stop Trick)**.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Separate Takes/Substitution Splice:** The scene on the pier and the scene on the boat were filmed separately. They filmed the man dropping the towel on the pier, then stopped recording. The man moved to the boat, and they filmed him appearing there.
2.  **Jump Cut/Hidden Cut:** The video cuts directly from the moment the towel obscures the man (or just after the splash) to the shot of him on the boat.
3.  **Misdirection:** The act of dropping the towel and the simultaneous splash in the water distract the viewer, making the cut less obvious and creating the illusion he jumped into the water and instantly reappeared on the boat."
1177-2,"Yes, the man appeared on the other boat due to video editing and visual effects.

**Explanation:** The instantaneous disappearance from the dock as the towel falls and the immediate reappearance standing on the boat several meters away is physically impossible to achieve in a single, unedited take. This is a common video editing technique where the falling object (the towel) is used to mask a cut, transitioning from a shot of the man on the dock to a separate shot of him already on the boat."
1177-3,"No, the man did not swim to the other boat. He jumped off the pier, and his immediate appearance on the boat further away was achieved through a video edit or illusion, not by swimming. The towel drop served as misdirection for the trick."
1177-7,B
1178-0,"The laptop appears because the video uses the Time Warp Scan filter. The creator physically folds the phone into an L-shape as the vertical scan line moves across it; the filter captures this manipulated shape sequentially, creating the visual illusion of a laptop as the final stage in a series of transformations."
1178-1,"The laptop is shown as the final item in a sequence where the creator uses a time warp scan filter to visually transform the smartphone into different electronic devices (Smartphone -> Mini Smartphone -> Mini Mini Smartphone -> Phone -> Tablet -> Laptop). To create the laptop illusion, the creator angles the smartphone to resemble the shape of an open laptop as the scan line passes."
1178-2,"**Yes**, the ""laptop"" in the final scene is the original smartphone. The appearance is created by a time scan visual effect filter, which distorts the image based on how the phone is tilted upwards (like opening a laptop) as the scan line moves across it."
1178-3,"**No**, the ""laptop"" is not a foldable device unfolding from the smartphone. It is the original smartphone being bent into an L-shape, and its appearance is distorted by the time scan visual effect to resemble a thin laptop."
1178-7,A
1181-0,"The Colosseum didn't disappear. The artist removed his initial painting from the frame and then held up the empty frame, perfectly aligning it with the actual Colosseum and the costumed actors standing in the background. This created an illusion, making it seem like the real scene was captured within the frame."
1181-1,"The technique used is a **Substitution Trick** employing the **Empty Frame Technique**.

**Explanation:** This is a practical, in-camera effect. The artist quickly replaces his crude painting with an empty picture frame. He then carefully aligns this empty frame so that the real Colosseum in the background is perfectly viewed *through* the frame, creating the visual illusion that the painting instantly became photorealistic."
1181-2,"**No, the Colosseum did not disappear.**

The effect seen in the video is a visual trick. The person holds up an empty picture frame and aligns it perfectly with the actual Colosseum and the actors in the background. This creates the illusion that the real scene is a picture contained within the frame, achieved through perspective and framing rather than post-production effects removing the building."
1181-3,"**No, the Colosseum did not disappear.**

The man removed his initial painting and held up an empty frame. He then aligned this empty frame perfectly with the actual Colosseum in the background, creating an optical illusion that made the real landmark appear as if it were the picture within the frame."
1181-7,A
1182-0,"The ladder appears suddenly due to a video edit. Filming was likely stopped after the man gestured with the small ladder, the large ladder was placed in the scene, and then filming resumed, with the two clips edited together to create the illusion of the ladder appearing instantly."
1182-1,"The ladder appears through **Transformation via Throwing** combined with **Instantaneous Replacement** using a **Visual Effect**.

**Explanation:** The man throws a miniature blue ladder prop towards the ground. Through a visual effect (likely video editing), the miniature ladder instantly disappears and is replaced by a full-sized ladder materializing in the same spot just before or as it would have landed."
1182-2,"Yes, the ladder is made to look full-sized through video editing techniques.

**Explanation:** The video shows the man pulling a miniature ladder from his waistband and throwing it. Through a visual effect achieved with video editing, this miniature object instantly appears as a full-sized ladder when it lands on the ground."
1182-3,"**Yes, the ladder changes size.**

The man initially holds and throws a very small, toy-sized blue ladder. Through a visual effect or editing, it is immediately replaced by a full-sized blue A-frame ladder standing on the ground, which he then approaches."
1182-7,A
1183-0,"Based on the video's visual narrative, the sky suddenly darkened because the character reached out and appeared to physically ""grab"" the sun from the sky, turning it into the glowing orb he then holds. This fantastical action is presented as the direct cause of the immediate shift from daylight to darkness."
1183-1,"Based on the video, the sky became dark so quickly because the man reached out and ""grabbed"" the sun, which was revealed to be a tangible, glowing orb. Removing this light source from the window instantly caused the scene outside to become night."
1183-2,"Yes, the sky darkens due to a combination of lighting changes and post-production effects.

The instantaneous shift from bright daylight to darkness outside the window, synchronized with the character interacting with the light source (turning the sun into an orb), is too rapid and fantastical to be natural. This effect is achieved by dimming the practical lights illuminating the room and digitally replacing the daytime view outside the window with a nighttime scene during post-production, along with adding the visual effects for the glowing orb and the subsequent fire."
1183-3,"No, the sky darkened because the person in the video appeared to magically grab the sun out of the sky. This action caused the scene outside the window to instantly change from day to night."
1183-7,A
1192-0,"The standing sprinkler suddenly appeared because the thrown object was intended to represent the ""Topiary Sprinkler"" weapon from the video game *Ratchet & Clank*. Its appearance is a visual effect (VFX/CGI) added during video editing to simulate the game's weapon transforming into a sprinkler upon landing."
1192-1,"The sudden appearance of the standing sprinkler is a visual effect (VFX/CGI) triggered by the orange projectile hitting the ground. This effect is designed to represent the ""Topiary Sprinkler"" weapon from the video game *Ratchet & Clank*, which the person firing the projectile explicitly mentions."
1192-2,"Yes.

**Explanation:** The sprinkler appears instantaneously the moment the projectile hits the ground, and it's shaped like a topiary figure referencing a video game weapon. This sudden materialization is physically impossible and is a clear indication that the sprinkler was added digitally using creative video editing or visual effects."
1192-3,"**Answer:**

No, the sprinkler's sudden appearance is highly unlikely to be due to it being hidden underground and activated by the thrown object. The object that appears is a large, shaped topiary, not a standard pop-up sprinkler head. Hiding such a large structure underground and having it emerge instantly upon impact is physically implausible. The effect was almost certainly achieved through video editing or visual effects (VFX)."

1203-0,"He pulled the towel upwards along the faucet's neck and over the top of its curve, utilizing the faucet's shape to keep the towel away from the water stream exiting below."
1203-1,"**Method:** Andrey twisted the towel tightly around the faucet spout before lifting it.

**Explanation:** By twisting the towel, he increased its tension and rigidity, preventing the middle section from sagging down into the water stream when he lifted it off the faucet."
1203-2,"Yes, the man (Andrey) successfully removed the towel by moving the open end of the towel loop across the water stream to the other side of the faucet before pulling it free."
1203-3,"**Yes.** The man (Andrey) pulled down the detachable spray head from the faucet and wrapped the towel around it, using the water stream coming directly from the spray head itself to wet the towel."
1203-7,B
1206-0,"The blue paint is spilling downwards due to normal gravity, but the low camera angle (looking up from below) creates a perspective trick, making it appear as though the paint is splashing upwards onto the person's face. The spill was intentional and staged for this visual effect."
1206-1,"**Answer:** The paint appears to spill upwards because the camera is positioned on the floor (or a very low surface) and is pointing directly upwards at the man. When he pours the paint downwards out of the can towards himself and the camera, gravity pulls the paint down, but this downward motion translates to an upward motion within the video frame due to the low-angle perspective."
1206-2,"**Yes**, the blue paint appears to be spilling upwards because the entire scene is likely filmed upside down, creating an illusion.

**Explanation:** Gravity is actually pulling the paint downwards in the real-world orientation. However, the man and the camera are positioned upside down relative to the ground. When he tips the can, the paint falls normally (downwards) due to gravity. When the footage is rotated 180 degrees for viewing, the paint *appears* to splash upwards onto his face and the surface behind him, seemingly defying gravity within the frame. The ironic text ""Gravity 😑"" further hints at this filming trick."
1206-3,"**Yes**, the paint is spilling because the open can is being held upside down above the person's head. Gravity pulls the liquid paint downwards out of the inverted container, causing it to spill onto them."
1206-7,C
1209-0,"The speed of the woman in the final photo is **zero**.

**Explanation:** The final image is a still photograph, which captures a single, frozen instant in time. By definition, a static image does not depict movement over time, so the speed represented *within the photo itself* is zero. While she was moving to create the splash, the photo freezes that motion."
1209-1,"**Answer:** Indeterminate / Cannot be determined.

**Explanation:** The final image is a still photograph, which captures a single, frozen moment in time. Speed is calculated as distance traveled over a period of time. Since a static photograph shows no passage of time and no distance traveled *within the image itself*, it's impossible to determine the woman's speed from that single frame alone. We can infer she was moving to create the splash, but the image doesn't contain the data needed to calculate a specific speed value."
1209-2,"**Yes.** The perception of speed in the final photo is largely an illusion created by the photographic composition and technique.

**Explanation:** The photo uses a fast shutter speed to freeze the motion of the water splashing and the leaves falling at the peak moment of action. Combined with the low camera angle which exaggerates the splash, this creates a dynamic image that strongly implies high speed and energy, even though the actual step into the puddle shown in the video wasn't necessarily that fast."
1209-3,"**Yes**, the woman's leg position, with one foot impacting the puddle and the other lifted high behind in a running-like stride, combined with the large, energetic splash of water and leaves, strongly suggests she is moving quickly or stomping forcefully into the puddle."
1209-7,C
1210-0,"**Answer:** There is no change in focus; the focus remains consistently on the framed photograph on the wall.

**Explanation:** Throughout the video clip, the photograph of the birds remains sharp and in focus, while the person viewing it in the foreground stays blurred. This indicates the focal plane was set on the artwork and did not shift during the duration shown."
1210-1,"The focus remains consistently fixed on the framed photograph throughout the video. There is no significant shift in the focal point; the artwork stays sharp while the person viewing it in the foreground remains blurred, emphasizing the photograph as the primary subject."
1210-2,"Yes, the focus of the video remains on the photograph of the two birds throughout the sequence.

**Explanation:** The photograph remains the sharpest and most central element in the frame for the entire duration. While a person is visible in the foreground, they are out of focus, directing the viewer's attention consistently to the artwork on the wall."
1210-3,"**No**, the focus does not shift from the background to the foreground. The photograph on the wall (background element) remains sharp and in focus throughout the video, while the person viewing it (foreground element) stays consistently blurry and out of focus."
1210-7,B
1214-0,"The motion of the shot is a **Pull Back** and **Moving Upwards / Ascending**.

**Explanation:** The camera starts relatively close to the woman from a high angle and then physically moves further away and higher up the staircase, revealing more of the surrounding architecture and making the subject appear smaller within the frame."
1214-1,"The camera pulls back vertically upwards.

**Explanation:** The shot starts relatively close to the woman from a top-down perspective and moves directly upwards, increasing the distance and revealing more of the surrounding spiral staircase while maintaining the overhead viewpoint."
1214-2,"**Yes**, after an initial wide shot reveals the staircase, the camera moves physically downwards and closer to the woman lying on the green padding. This movement makes her appear larger in the frame, creating a zoom-in effect."
1214-3,"**Yes**, the camera moves away from the woman (or cuts to a shot taken from further away). This is evident because the video transitions from a closer view where the woman occupies a larger portion of the frame to a wider shot where she appears much smaller, revealing the full structure of the spiral staircase around her."
1214-7,C
1223-0,"The camera tilts downwards and zooms in slightly for the last throw. This results in a tighter frame that focuses more intently on the pans and the target cup on the floor, whereas the previous throws were filmed from a static, wider angle."
1223-1,"For the final throw, the camera **zooms in and tilts downwards**, creating a **tighter frame** that focuses primarily on the **target area (the pans and the cup)** rather than the thrower. This results in a **more top-down perspective** compared to the wider, more level angle used for the earlier throws."
1223-2,"Yes, the camera zooms in on the floor during the last throw. Unlike the previous stationary wide views, the final attempt (starting around 0:19) features a tighter frame focusing more closely on the pans, the ball, and the target cup."
1223-3,"Yes, the camera angle remains the same during the last throw. The shot is static, meaning the camera's position and framing do not change throughout the sequence shown in the video."
1223-7,D
1225-0,"**Both the shorter man and the shorter woman.**

**Explanation:** After the taller man moves aside and the shorter man enters fully (around 0:03-0:04), the camera zooms in slightly, framing both the shorter man (in the grey shirt) and the shorter woman (in the pink shirt) as they face each other near the doorway. They occupy the central part of the frame together."
1225-1,"**Both the man and woman with dwarfism.**

**Explanation:** When the camera finishes its initial zoom (around the 0:04 mark), the frame is tightly focused on the man who just entered (the ""short friend"") and the woman standing opposite him. They are the central subjects of the shot at that moment."
1225-2,"Yes, the person mainly visible after the initial entrance (around 0:03 onwards) and throughout the subsequent scenes is a man wearing a gray t-shirt with the Under Armour logo. He becomes the central focus as he explores the house."
1225-3,"**Answer:** No, the person mainly visible after the first camera cut/zoom is a man wearing a grey t-shirt and black shorts.

**Explanation:** After the initial scene at the doorway, the camera follows the shorter male friend as he explores the house (sitting on the couch, going to the kitchen, etc.), making him the main subject. He is not a woman, nor is he wearing a red dress."
1225-7,C
1229-0,"The object in front of the mirror (pawn) is different from its reflection (king) because the image is the result of either **digital editing** or a **specialized camera mode** (like panorama or object capture).

**Explanation:** The video shows the king being swapped for the pawn *during* the process of taking the picture with a specific phone camera mode (indicated by the on-screen guide). This mode likely captured the king's reflection initially and then combined it with the later image of the pawn, or the final image was edited after being taken to replace the pawn's reflection with the king's."
1229-1,"The discrepancy is caused by an **Augmented Reality (AR) application** running on the smartphone.

**Explanation:** The video shows the user pointing their phone at the scene, and the phone screen displays the altered reflection (pawn reflecting as king) in real-time. Furthermore, a brief shot of the phone screen reveals an interface with guiding lines and instructions, typical of AR applications used to create special effects by overlaying digital elements onto the camera feed. While video editing could be used to create the final polished shot, the process shown suggests AR is the primary method being employed."
1229-2,"**No**, the difference between the object and its reflection is not due to the use of a panoramic photography feature.

**Explanation:** This is a physical optical illusion created by placing a pawn in front of the mirror and a king piece behind or beside the mirror. The king is positioned carefully so that, from the camera's specific angle, its reflection appears in the mirror exactly where the pawn's reflection would be expected. The phone's camera, whether in panoramic mode or not, simply captures the scene as it is physically arranged. The panoramic feature is used to record the pre-existing illusion, not to generate it."
1229-3,"**No.**

**Explanation:**

The difference between the object (pawn) and its reflection (king) is not because the mirror is a special type. Real mirrors, whether flat, concave, or convex, reflect the object actually placed in front of them. While curved mirrors can distort the size or orientation of the reflection, they cannot fundamentally change the shape of the object from a pawn to a king.

The video shows the king piece being physically swapped for a pawn piece. The final image, where the pawn is in front of the mirror but the reflection is a king, is the result of digital manipulation, editing, or a special camera effect (as suggested by the phone's interface during capture), not a property of the mirror itself."
1229-7,C
1231-0,"The water appears to flow sideways (or ""backward"" relative to its expected downward path) because the video frame has been deliberately rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. While gravity still pulls the water downwards in reality, this rotation changes the viewer's frame of reference, making the downward flow appear as horizontal movement across the screen, creating a compelling optical illusion."
1231-1,"The waterfall appears to flow in reverse because the final shot focuses on the **reflection** of the scene in the puddle. Reflections are naturally inverted (upside down). When this reflected image is then **rotated 90 degrees** for the final view, the water (which is flowing downwards in reality but upwards in the inverted reflection) appears to be flowing upwards within the rotated video frame."
1231-2,"Yes, the backward flow of the waterfall at the end of the video is due to reverse video processing. Water naturally flows downwards due to gravity, so seeing it flow upwards is a clear indication that the video clip has been played in reverse for creative effect."
1231-3,"**No**, the waterfall does not appear to flow backward because of special effects. The illusion is created by filming the reflection of the waterfall in a puddle on the ground. When the video footage is rotated 180 degrees, the reflection is inverted, making the downward flow of the water in the reflection appear as if it is flowing upwards."
1231-7,D
1233-0,"The photo is a panorama taken with the phone held upside down. Panoramic mode captures the scene sequentially over time, stitching different moments together.

**Explanation:**

1.  The camera first captured the reflection of the kneeling woman.
2.  As the person taking the photo panned the camera across the puddle (by tilting it upwards since it was upside down), it captured the reflection of the man who was standing there initially.
3.  The man walked away *during* this panning process.
4.  The final panoramic image combines the earlier moment (capturing the man's reflection) with the later moment (where only the woman's reflection is being captured in that specific area), resulting in both reflections appearing in the composite shot, even though the man is not physically present in the final composition's ""real-world"" view."
1233-1,"The image was created using the phone's vertical panorama feature while pointed at the reflection in the puddle. The camera captured the scene sequentially as it was moved:

1.  It first recorded the reflection of the man standing.
2.  The man then moved out of the scene.
3.  The camera continued its panoramic sweep and captured the reflection of the woman kneeling.

The final photograph is a composite image, digitally stitched together from these different moments, resulting in both reflections appearing in the single picture even though the man was no longer there when the woman's reflection was fully captured."
1233-2,"**Yes**, the reason for the two reflections in the final photo is due to the use of the panoramic camera function.

**Explanation:** The video shows the photographer activating the ""Panorámica"" (Panoramic) mode. This mode works by capturing a series of images as the camera is moved (swept) across a scene and then stitching these images together into one wider photograph. During this sweep, the camera captured the reflection of the man at one point and the reflection of the woman at another (or throughout), combining both into the final composite image."
1233-3,"**No**, the reflection is not due to image synthesis technology. It is a real reflection captured from the water's surface using a specific photographic technique involving holding the phone upside down close to the puddle and taking a panoramic shot vertically to emphasize the natural reflection of the person and the sky."
1233-7,A
1235-0,"**Answer:** 37
**Explanation:** The pattern observed in the video is to concatenate the second number (b) with the sum of the two numbers (a+b).
*   2 + 2: Second number is 2, sum is 4. Concatenate -> 24.
*   3 + 3: Second number is 3, sum is 6. Concatenate -> 36.
*   4 + 5: Second number is 5, sum is 9. Concatenate -> 59.
*   Therefore, for 4 + 3: The second number is 3, the sum is 7. Concatenating gives 37."
1235-1,"Based on the pattern shown in the video:

*   2 + 2 = 24 (Concatenate '2' and the sum '4')
*   3 + 3 = 36 (Concatenate '3' and the sum '6')
*   4 + 5 = 59 (Concatenate '5' and the sum '9')

Following this pattern for 4 + 3:

*   Calculate the sum: 4 + 3 = 7
*   Concatenate the second number ('3') and the sum ('7')

Therefore, the result is **37**."
1235-2,"Yes, based on one interpretation of the pattern in the video, 4 + 3 equals 37.

**Explanation:**
The pattern observed in the examples `2+2=24`, `3+3=36`, and `4+5=59` can be interpreted as concatenating the second number (`b`) with the sum of the two numbers (`a+b`).
Applying this pattern to `4 + 3`:
*   The second number (`b`) is 3.
*   The sum (`a+b`) is `4 + 3 = 7`.
*   Concatenating 3 and 7 gives 37."
1235-3,"**No.**

According to the pattern shown in the video (concatenating the second number with the sum of the two numbers), 4 + 3 equals 37 (3 concatenated with 4+3=7), not 412."

1236-0,"Yes, the method shown is useful for producing the correct calculation result **specifically when dividing numbers ending in zero (multiples of 10) by 5.**

**Explanation:**
The trick works because dividing by 5 is mathematically equivalent to dividing by 10 and then multiplying by 2 (N ÷ 5 = (N / 10) * 2). In the video, crossing out the zero effectively divides the number by 10, and multiplying the remaining digit by 2 completes the equivalent calculation, yielding the correct answer for these specific types of problems."
1236-1,"Yes, the method demonstrated in the video effectively yields accurate calculation results for the specific examples shown (numbers ending in zero).

This trick works because dividing a number by 5 is mathematically equivalent to first dividing the number by 10 and then multiplying the result by 2. For numbers ending in zero, removing the zero is the same as dividing by 10, and the trick then completes the process by multiplying the remaining digit(s) by 2."
1236-2,"Yes, the method shown in the video is effective and produces accurate results for the specific division problems presented.

**Explanation:** Dividing by 5 is mathematically equivalent to multiplying the number by 2 and then dividing by 10. For numbers ending in zero (like 10, 30, 60, 90), removing the zero performs the division by 10, and doubling the remaining digit completes the equivalent calculation correctly."
1236-3,"**No.** The method shown in the video is effective for dividing multiples of 10 by 5, but it does **not** involve squaring the numbers. Squaring means multiplying a number by itself. The trick actually involves removing the zero (effectively dividing by 10) and then multiplying the remaining digit by 2."
1236-7,C
1237-0,"Based on the video, the answer to `9 + 9 = ?` is **45**.

**Explanation:**
One observed pattern is multiplying the first number by its position in the sequence plus one:
*   `4 * (1+1) = 4 * 2 = 08`
*   `5 * (2+1) = 5 * 3 = 15`
*   `6 * (3+1) = 6 * 4 = 24`
Applying this pattern to the last line:
*   `9 * (4+1) = 9 * 5 = 45`"
1237-1,"The result of 9 + 9 according to the pattern is **63**.

**Explanation:**
The pattern followed in the quiz is `a + a = a * (a - 2)`.
*   `4 + 4 = 4 * (4 - 2) = 4 * 2 = 8`
*   `5 + 5 = 5 * (5 - 2) = 5 * 3 = 15`
*   `6 + 6 = 6 * (6 - 2) = 6 * 4 = 24`
Applying this pattern to the last line:
*   `9 + 9 = 9 * (9 - 2) = 9 * 7 = 63`"
1237-2,"**Yes**, 9 + 9 = 63 based on the pattern.

**Explanation:** The pattern observed in the video is `n + n = n * (n - 2)`.
*   4 * (4 - 2) = 4 * 2 = 8
*   5 * (5 - 2) = 5 * 3 = 15
*   6 * (6 - 2) = 6 * 4 = 24
Following this pattern:
*   9 * (9 - 2) = 9 * 7 = 63"
1237-3,"**No, 9 + 9 = 63.**

**Explanation:** The pattern established is `n + n = n * (n - 2)`. For the examples: 4 * (4-2) = 4 * 2 = 8; 5 * (5-2) = 5 * 3 = 15; 6 * (6-2) = 6 * 4 = 24. Following this pattern, 9 * (9-2) = 9 * 7 = 63."

1239-0,"Yes, the method shown correctly generates the results for the 19 times table from 1 to 10."
1239-1,"**Yes**, the method shown, when correctly applied, produces accurate calculation results for the 19 times table from 19x1 to 19x10.

**Explanation:** The method involves writing the odd numbers sequentially from 1 to 19 (1, 3, 5, ..., 17, 19) and then appending the digits 9 down to 0 (9, 8, 7, ..., 1, 0) to these numbers. This specific pattern accurately generates the correct multiples of 19."
1239-2,"Yes, the method is effective in producing the correct results for the multiplication table of 19 (from 1 to 10).

**Explanation:** The method correctly generates the products by first writing the sequence of odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ..., 19) and then appending the digits 9 down to 0 next to them, which accurately constructs the multiples 19, 38, 57, ..., 190."
1239-3,"Yes, the method shown correctly produces the results for the 19 times table from 19x1 to 19x10.

Regarding efficiency:
*   For generating the **entire** table sequentially from 1 to 10 as shown, this pattern method (writing odd numbers 1-19 and digits 9-0) can be **more efficient** than performing ten separate standard multiplications.
*   However, if you only need **one specific answer** (e.g., 19 x 7), this method is **less efficient** than standard multiplication or recalling the answer from memory. Standard multiplication is also a universal method, unlike this specific trick for 19."

1242-0,"The result of the man's magic show was that he successfully made the bill disappear from under the cup using sleight of hand (palming it), but the woman immediately found the hidden bill in his hand. The final surprise, however, was the woman's shocked reaction upon unrolling and looking at the bill itself."
1242-1,"**Outcome:** The bill remained under the cup and was retrieved by the woman. However, upon inspecting the bill after picking it up, she reacted with extreme surprise, indicating the actual trick likely involved altering or swapping the bill itself."
1242-2,"Yes, the man's magic trick succeeded in surprising the woman, but not exactly as the question implies. Her surprised reaction occurred when she discovered the money hidden *inside* the cup he handed her, after it had vanished from *under* the cup on the table."
1242-3,"**No**, the trick likely didn't fail *because* the object remained visible. The visibility appears intentional, serving as misdirection for a different effect or joke, evidenced by the woman's surprised reaction after picking up the object."

1255-0,"**Answer:** Yellow

**Explanation:** The man in the blue shirt runs underneath the parachute immediately after the voice calls out ""Yellow"" at the 0:26 mark in the video."
1255-1,"**Color Called:** Yellow

**Explanation:** The instruction given was ""When you hear your color run underneath"". The man in the blue shirt waited as ""Red"", ""Pink"", and ""Orange"" were called. He only ran underneath the parachute immediately after the caller shouted ""Yellow!"", indicating this was his assigned color."
1255-2,"Yes, the man ran underneath the parachute after the color yellow was called. The video shows him running under the parachute immediately after the word ""yellow"" is spoken at the 0:25 mark."
1255-3,"**No**, the man in the blue shirt did not run underneath when ""red"" was called. He remained standing and holding his section of the parachute while a different participant ran under."
1255-7,A
1260-0,"The man in white looks surprised primarily because his friend has an immediate and extreme negative reaction after tasting the food, likely due to intense spiciness. His expression shows astonishment at the severity of his friend's reaction, especially in contrast to his own seemingly milder experience up to that point. The comedic editing with meme faces further emphasizes this moment of contrasting reactions."
1260-1,"Based on the video and the provided options, the best answer is:

The man in white appears shocked due to the **unexpected severity and suddenness** of his friend's negative reaction to the food, especially given the **stark contrast** to his own, seemingly milder experience, likely caused by the food being **extremely spicy or unpleasant**."
1260-2,"**No**, the man in white is not surprised because the man in black ate his food.

**Explanation:** The video shows both men sharing food from a single plate. The man in black has a strong negative reaction (likely due to the food being very spicy or unpleasant) immediately after taking a bite himself. The man in white does not appear surprised about his food being taken, but rather observes the other man's reaction."
1260-3,"**No, the man in white does not appear surprised by the spiciness.**

**Explanation:** His reaction after eating the food is very calm and minimal. In contrast, the man in the black shirt has a strong, immediate negative reaction, indicating *he* was the one surprised or overwhelmed by the spice level. The video highlights this difference in reactions as the ""end"" event."
1260-7,C
1261-0,"The reflection shows two men with torches, while the scene above shows a woman reading and another man throwing papers, because the final image is a digital composite. The creators filmed the scene above the mirror (woman reading, man throwing papers) separately from the scene intended for the reflection (men with torches, smoke). These two separate shots were then combined digitally in post-production editing to create the final artistic illusion."
1261-1,"The presence of the two men in the reflection is due to **intentional staging** for the photograph. As shown in the setup part of the video clip, the men were physically present, positioned near the tree base with props (like a torch and smoke), specifically to be captured in the mirror's reflection from the photographer's low angle. They are part of the complete artistic composition, creating a juxtaposition between the woman reading above and the scene reflected below."
1261-2,"Yes, the presence of the two men with torches in the reflection, while the woman reads peacefully above, is due to the photos being intentionally shot and edited together (composited).

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows two distinct setups being photographed: first, the woman reading under the tree, and second, a separate setup with the men, torches, and smoke being photographed specifically for the reflection in the mirror. The final image combines these two separately captured scenes."
1261-3,"Yes, the reflection of the two men holding torches is created by using a mirror placed flat on the ground beneath the tree. The video shows the team setting up this mirror (0:19-0:22) and the photographer shooting at a low angle towards it to capture the reflection of the men (who are standing further back) for the final composite photograph (0:23-0:26)."
1261-7,B
1262-0,"The girl in the pink top was **Scared, Shocked, Startled,** and **Distressed**.

**Explanation:** She likely believed the performer was an inanimate statue. When the performer suddenly moved after she touched him, the unexpected animation startled and shocked her, leading to fear and visible distress (crying)."
1262-1,"Based on the video, after grabbing the performer's arm, the girl felt **scared, distressed, and confused.**

*   Her immediate, loud crying and shouting indicate significant distress and likely fear, possibly triggered by the performer's unnatural stillness and lack of reaction, which she didn't understand (confusion)."
1262-2,"Yes, the girl in the pink top felt worried and scared after she held the performer's arm. Her immediate and intense crying after touching his hand indicates she was startled, frightened, or worried that she might have ""broken"" the living statue."
1262-3,"No, the girl did not feel amused after holding the performer's arm. In both instances shown in the video, she immediately started crying loudly, indicating she was startled, distressed, or frightened by the interaction, not amused."

1275-0,"**Red shirt guy wins.**

**Explanation:** He was the last player to successfully add water drops to the glass without causing it to overflow. The player after him (blue shirt guy) broke the surface tension and made the water spill."
1275-1,"**Answer:** The person in the red shirt is the winner.

**Explanation:** The challenge involves adding water to a glass without making it spill. The person in the blue shirt added the final drops that caused the water to overflow. Therefore, the person who took the turn immediately before him and successfully added water without spilling (the person in the red shirt) is the winner."
1275-2,"Yes, the person in the blue T-shirt lost the challenge.

The challenge was to add water to the glass without it overflowing. The video shows the water level rising above the rim due to surface tension as each person takes a turn. The challenge ended when the person in the blue T-shirt added water, causing the surface tension to break and the water to spill over the edge. The other participants successfully completed their turns without spilling before him."
1275-3,"**No, the person in the blue shirt did not win the challenge.**

He lost because he added the final drops of water (around 0:49), which caused the surface tension to break and the water to spill over the rim of the glass."

1276-0,"The lemon icons at the top of the video serve as a **Challenge Progress Indicator** and **Completion Tracker**. Each icon represents a stage or level in the challenge, corresponding to a participant eating a progressively larger lemon candy, with checkmarks appearing to signify the completion of each stage."
1276-1,The lemon icon string at the top of the video serves as a **Progress Tracker** and **Challenge Level Marker**. It visually indicates the sequence of participants in the eating challenge and tracks their completion (with checkmarks) as they consume progressively larger lemon-shaped candies.
1276-2,"**Yes**, the lemon icons at the top of the video represent the different sizes of the lemon candies eaten by the participants. The icons appear to increase in size from left to right, mirroring the progressively larger lemon candies consumed by each person in the video, and a checkmark appears over the corresponding icon after each size is eaten, visually tracking the challenge's progression."
1276-3,"**No**, the lemon icons at the top of the video do not indicate the level of sourness. Instead, they represent the **level or stage** of the challenge, corresponding to the progressively **increasing size** of the lemon candy being eaten by each participant. As each larger slice is consumed, another icon gets a checkmark, marking the completion of that size-based stage."
1276-7,D
1278-0,"**Answer:** The difference is 3 attempts.

**Explanation:** The first challenge where attempts are mentioned is the beer bottle into the bucket, which states ""First try"" (1 attempt). The second challenge where attempts are mentioned is the domino run, which states ""4 tries"". The difference between these two is 4 - 1 = 3 attempts."
1278-1,"The difference is 3 attempts.

**Explanation:** The first challenge in the video that explicitly states the number of attempts is the Heineken bottle challenge, which took ""First try"" (1 attempt). The second challenge that explicitly states the number of attempts is the domino path challenge, which took ""4 tries"". The difference between these two is 4 - 1 = 3 attempts."
1278-2,"**No, the difference is not just one.** The second challenge explicitly states it was achieved on the ""First try"" (1 attempt). The first challenge is labeled ""16 hours"", strongly implying it took numerous attempts over that period, making the difference significantly larger than one."
1278-3,"**Yes.** The second challenge was completed on the ""First try"" (1 attempt). The first challenge took ""16 hours"", which implies it required significantly more than 3 attempts. Therefore, the difference in the number of attempts between the first challenge and the second challenge (1 attempt) is greater than two."

1283-0,"**Answer:** The child in the red/maroon uniform with bright orange/yellow shoes, who started in the middle lane (third from the left), is the fastest at the end of the video.

**Explanation:** This runner takes a clear lead shortly after the start and is significantly ahead of the other runners as they approach the curve when the video clip concludes."
1283-1,"**Answer:** The runner in the red/maroon uniform, wearing number 237, is the fastest runner at the conclusion of the video.
**Explanation:** This runner has established a clear and significant lead over all other competitors by the time the video ends."
1283-2,"**Answer:** Yes, the child in the red outfit who starts in the middle lane is the fastest.
*   **Explanation:** From the start of the race, this child quickly takes the lead and maintains a significant distance ahead of the other runners throughout the clip."
1283-3,"**No**, the child in the green outfit is not the fastest runner at the end of the video. The runner in the red uniform (number 237) is clearly in the lead and appears to be the fastest."
1283-7,C
1288-0,"The blond man's emotion appears to be **Mock Anger / Playful Aggression** or a **Comedic Grimace**.

**Explanation:** After playfully trying to get the woman's attention with exaggerated gestures and then tapping her with a stick, his final expression—a grimace with a direct stare—seems intentionally exaggerated and humorous, fitting the overall silly context. It looks like a playful, non-serious display of annoyance or defiance after his prank was noticed."
1288-1,"The blond man appears **surprised and caught off guard**.

**Explanation:** His dramatic performance abruptly stops, his eyes widen, and his confident expression vanishes the moment the woman turns around holding sticks, indicating he was completely unprepared for her reaction."
1288-2,"Yes, the man appears frustrated. His facial expression changes from performative concentration to annoyance the moment the woman reveals the stick behind the towel, indicating his trick or illusion was exposed."
1288-3,"Yes, the blond man appears playful and energetic at the end of the video. His exaggerated ""magic"" gestures with the towel, followed by playfully tapping the woman with a hidden stick, and his resulting facial expression and pose when she turns around all indicate a lighthearted, teasing, and energetic demeanor."
1288-7,D
1290-0,The man is shocked and astonished. His mouth drops wide open and his eyes widen significantly as he looks up in disbelief at how high the pillow was thrown.
1290-1,"He looks shocked and surprised.

**Explanation:** At the end of the video, after throwing the pillow upwards, the man's mouth is wide open, his eyes are wide, and he is looking up, clearly indicating a strong reaction of shock and surprise at where the pillow went or how high it went."
1290-2,"Yes, the man shows clear signs of shock, but not pain.

**Explanation:** His immediate reaction involves his eyes widening significantly and his mouth opening wide in an expression of astonishment or surprise the moment the pillow hits the ceiling unexpectedly. There are no indications of physical pain; his reaction is one of disbelief at the outcome."
1290-3,"**No, the man does not seem amused or entertained.**

His final expression, with a wide-open mouth and eyes looking up at the falling pillow, indicates shock, surprise, or perhaps exaggerated mock horror/failure, rather than amusement or finding the situation funny."
1290-7,C
1293-0,"The bottle cap was suspended in the air using a very thin, barely visible wire or thread, likely held by someone or attached to something out of the camera's view. This allowed it to be precisely positioned for the photograph while water was sprayed to create the effect of droplets around it."
1293-1,The method used involved suspending the bottle cap with a thin string or wire and spraying water droplets around it. The string was then digitally removed from the final photograph in post-processing.
1293-2,"**Yes**, the bottle cap in the second scene was made to look like it was flying using a thin string and clever camera angles.

**Explanation:** The behind-the-scenes footage in the video clearly shows the bottle cap suspended in the air by a thin string held just above it, while the photo is taken from a low angle to capture the cap against the sky and create the illusion of flight, enhanced by sprayed water droplets."
1293-3,"**No**, the bottle cap did not fly because someone flicked it.

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows (around 0:06-0:08) that the bottle cap was suspended in the air using a thin string or wire held by an assistant. This allowed the photographer to position it precisely for the shot while another person sprayed water to create the droplet effect."
1293-7,D
1294-0,"Based on the narrative in the video, the meat appeared on the grill because the editing juxtaposes the scene of CZN Burak cutting meat in a hot air balloon directly with the scene of a steak suddenly landing on the chef's grill below. The chef's surprised reaction and upward glance further imply that the meat unexpectedly arrived from above, linking it to the preceding hot air balloon scene."
1294-1,"The piece of meat ended up on the grill due to **video editing**.

**Explanation:** The video consists of two separate, unrelated clips edited together. The first clip shows a man cutting meat in a hot air balloon. The second clip shows a chef grilling corn, who turns away briefly; during this moment (likely achieved through a cut in filming or off-camera action as part of a staged event), the steak is placed on the grill to create a surprising and humorous effect when he turns back. There is no actual connection between the meat in the balloon and the steak on the grill."
1294-2,"**Answer:** No.

**Explanation:** The video shows two separate, edited clips. The first features a man slicing what appears to be cured meat in a hot air balloon. The second clip shows a different man (a chef) on the ground manually placing a raw steak onto a grill. The types of meat are different, and the steak is clearly placed by the chef, not dropped from above."
1294-3,"**No**, the meat was not placed on the grill using tongs. The video shows the chef placing corn on the grill with tongs, then turning his back. While his back is turned, the steak appears suddenly on the grill, seemingly thrown or dropped from off-screen, and the chef looks surprised when he turns back and sees it."
1294-7,D
1298-0,"The man's football did not return to him primarily because of **gravity** and the principles of **projectile motion**. When he threw the ball upwards and slightly forwards, gravity pulled it back down to Earth along a parabolic path, causing it to land on the ground some distance away rather than returning to his hands. Additionally, the object was a **standard football**, lacking any special mechanism (like a boomerang or elastic cord) that would cause it to reverse direction and fly back to the thrower."
1298-1,"**Answer:** The man's football did not come back to him because he threw it upwards and forwards into an open area where there was no surface for it to rebound off.

**Explanation:** Unlike the child's ball which hit the wall and bounced back, the man's ball followed its natural trajectory determined by the force and direction of his throw and the pull of gravity, landing on the ground away from him."
1298-2,"**No, the football did not land in the blue bucket.** The video clearly shows the football hitting the ground in front of the bucket and stopping near the wall."
1298-3,"Yes, the man's football was unable to return because, after bouncing off the wall, a white dog ran into the frame and intercepted the ball."
1298-7,D
1299-0,"The elevator door closed because the maximum hold time allowed by pressing the 'door open' button was reached. Elevator systems often have a limit on how long the door can be held open, even with the button pressed, to ensure efficiency and prevent delays; once this limit is exceeded, the system overrides the hold command and closes the door."
1299-1,"The elevator door shut because its **timeout mechanism** was activated. Elevators are programmed to close their doors after a certain period, even if the 'door open' button is held continuously. This **overrides the hold command** once the **maximum allowed hold time is exceeded**, ensuring the elevator remains operational and doesn't cause delays."
1299-2,"Yes, the elevator door closed automatically as the buffer time was up.

**Explanation:** The video shows a person inside the elevator attempting to hold the door open for someone running towards it. Despite her efforts, the door begins to close on its own, indicating that the elevator's pre-set time limit (buffer time) for holding the door open had expired, triggering the automatic closing mechanism."
1299-3,"**No, the elevator door did not close because the person inside pressed the button.**

**Explanation:** The video shows the elevator door beginning to close automatically *before* the person inside moves their hand to press the 'close door' button. The button press occurred *after* the door was already in motion, likely due to the elevator's automatic timer expiring."
1299-7,A
1307-0,"**Answer:** The speed difference between the two tires constantly fluctuates after the ramp area.

**Explanation:** Due to the uneven, bumpy terrain, both tires bounce unpredictably. This causes their individual speeds to change rapidly and independently of each other. At some points, one tire might momentarily speed up relative to the other after hitting a downward slope or slow down more abruptly after hitting a bump. Therefore, the difference in their speeds is not constant but varies significantly as they cover more forward distance."
1307-1,"The speed difference between the two tires decreases after they pass the ramp area.

**Explanation:** The larger tire is moving significantly faster than the smaller tire. Air resistance increases dramatically with speed and is also affected by the object's size. Therefore, the faster, larger tire experiences considerably more air resistance than the smaller tire. This greater resistance force acts more strongly against the larger tire's motion, causing it to accelerate less (or decelerate more) relative to the smaller tire, thus reducing the difference in their speeds."
1307-2,"**No**, the tire initially lagging behind does not surpass the leading tire in speed or distance after the ramp. The video clearly shows the leading tire traveling further through the air after the ramp and continuing to roll a greater distance on the ground compared to the second tire."
1307-3,"**Answer:** No.

**Explanation:** While the large tire takes the lead at the start and the drone flies through it, the main ""threading the needle"" stunt highlighted later in the video involves the drone flying through two different, stationary tires further down the hill."
1307-7,B
1308-0,"Based on the visual information in the animation, the speed of the black missile appears to remain constant while it is visible on screen. There are no visual cues, such as changes in its rate of movement across the frame or alterations in its exhaust trail relative to its motion, to suggest it is accelerating or decelerating during this segment."
1308-1,"The black missile accelerates rapidly after launch, reaching an extremely high hypersonic speed (stated as Mach 7). This speed significantly surpasses that of the bullet, and the missile appears to maintain this high velocity during its cruise phase shown in the animation."
1308-2,"**No**, the animation does not show the black missile decelerating to match the bullet's speed. Instead, the missile appears in the frame already traveling faster than the bullet and immediately begins to accelerate rapidly, increasing the distance between them."
1308-3,"**Answer:** No, the animation does not clearly depict the black missile's speed continuously increasing during the short time it is shown.

**Explanation:** While the missile has an exhaust plume suggesting active propulsion (which often causes acceleration), the visual focus of the animation in that segment is on demonstrating the missile's vastly superior speed compared to the bullet, rather than explicitly showing an ongoing increase in the missile's own velocity. It appears to maintain a constant, very high speed during the overtaking sequence."

1310-0,**Celine Michiel used less time.** She is seen placing her final ball into the hoop and reacting just before the man finishes placing his last ball.
1310-1,"**Celine Michiel (the woman)** finished the game in the shortest amount of time.

**Explanation:** Both participants started at the same time. The video clearly shows Celine Michiel placing her final ball into her designated hoop slightly before the man places his final ball into his hoop."
1310-2,"Yes, Michiel completed the game faster than Celine. He finished placing his last ball into the hoop around the 0:21 mark, while Celine finished placing her last ball around the 0:24 mark."
1310-3,"**No**, the soccer ball icons are a visual scoreboard that tracks how many balls each player has successfully placed in their ring. Celine had more icons appear sooner *because* she was completing the task faster, not the other way around. The icons are a result of her performance, not the cause of her speed."
1310-7,B
1312-0,"Yes, the treadmill is running while the person is sleeping. The belt is visibly moving, causing the person under the blanket to slide backward."
1312-1,"**Yes**, the treadmill was active while the person was trying to sleep. The video clearly shows the treadmill belt moving backward, causing the person lying under the blanket to slide off the end of the machine."
1312-2,"Yes, the person had to crawl forward to avoid falling off the treadmill because the belt was actively moving backward while they were simulating sleeping on it."
1312-3,"**No**, the treadmill belt was not stationary while the person was sleeping. The video shows the belt moving, causing the person under the blanket to slide backward, requiring them to push forward to stay in place."
1312-7,C
1318-0,"Based on the video, the daughter's emotions at the end appear to be **Unimpressed and Nonplussed.**

**Explanation:** She watches her dad's cat imitation with a neutral, almost blank facial expression. She doesn't smile, laugh, or show any amusement, suggesting she is unimpressed by his antics. She also seems slightly taken aback or unsure how to react to his bizarre behavior, indicating she is nonplussed."
1318-1,"Based on the daughter's neutral, slightly averted gaze and lack of any positive reaction (like smiling or laughing) while her dad makes exaggerated cat noises, the best description of her feeling is **Unimpressed and Annoyed.**

**Explanation:** She appears completely unmoved by her father's silly attempt to imitate a cat, suggesting she's unimpressed. Her lack of engagement and slightly negative expression also indicate she might be annoyed that he's not taking her request seriously and is instead resorting to disruptive antics."
1318-2,"Yes, the daughter seems speechless. Her fixed, neutral expression and complete lack of verbal or physical reaction while her father acts like a cat next to her suggest she is stunned into silence."
1318-3,"No, the daughter does not appear amused or entertained by her father's antics at the end. Her facial expression is neutral, bordering on unimpressed, and she looks away rather than engaging with his performance."
1318-7,C
1321-0,"**Friendly and Acknowledging.**

**Explanation:** At the end of the video, the girl looks directly at the camera with a soft, pleasant smile. This indicates she is acknowledging the person filming in a friendly and approachable manner."
1321-1,"**Answer:**

At the conclusion of the video, the girl with braids appears **attentive, interested, and pleased.**

**Explanation:**

She is looking forward intently along with the rest of the crowd, indicating she is paying attention and is interested in what everyone is focused on. Her subtle smile suggests she is enjoying the moment or the atmosphere of the event."
1321-2,"**No.**

The girl's expression at the end of the video appears more neutral or perhaps mildly curious rather than dazed and confused. She turns her head slightly as the man looks at the camera, but she doesn't show clear signs of disorientation or bewilderment specifically caused by his actions."
1321-3,"Yes, the girl with braids appears happy at the end of the video. She is smiling while looking towards the person filming as the video concludes."

1324-0,"**Mood:** Shocked and Alarmed.

**Explanation:** They are shocked and alarmed because after the man successfully demonstrated splitting an apple, toilet paper, and a water bottle with his hands, the woman handed him their small dog. The man held the dog as if he might split it too, leading to a moment of sudden realization and fear for the dog's safety from both individuals."
1324-1,"**Emotion:** Both the man and woman are shocked and surprised at the conclusion of the video.

**Cause:** Their shock is caused by an unexpected action or reaction from the dog immediately after the man took hold of it, startling them both."
1324-2,"Yes, the man and woman are visibly shocked at the end of the video.

**Explanation:** Their shock stems from the sudden realization that the man, who had been mechanically splitting or altering every object handed to him (apple, toilet paper, water), might unthinkingly apply the same action to the living dog. The shock appears to be a reaction to this dawning awareness and the potential danger, rather than remorse for an action already completed."
1324-3,"**No**, the man and woman do not appear to be in a light-hearted and playful mood at the end of the video. Their final expressions are ones of shock or surprise, occurring immediately after the man takes the dog, accompanied by an abrupt sound effect. This suggests the interaction ended unexpectedly or startlingly, rather than playfully."

1329-0,"**Mood:** Playful and Teasing.

**Explanation:** The woman was calmly stretching. The moment the man sits down after dealing with the child, she instantly gets up and runs towards him. This sudden, energetic shift, combined with the caption ""King of a few seconds,"" indicates she's playfully teasing him about his very brief moment of rest and initiating a lighthearted interaction or chase."
1329-1,"**Mood:** Playfully Annoyed / Mock Angry

**Cause:** Her moment of stretching/personal time was interrupted when the man, after watching the child for only a very short period (as implied by ""King of a few seconds""), put the child down and immediately sat on the couch to relax, signalling her break was over. She jumps up to playfully chase or confront him about it."
1329-2,"**No**, the woman's mood at the end of the video does not reflect genuine frustration or anger.

**Explanation:** Her reaction—getting up quickly, running towards the man, and hitting him lightly—appears playful rather than aggressive. His response of moving away quickly also seems part of a lighthearted interaction. The overall context, including the humorous text overlay, suggests a playful moment between the couple, not genuine annoyance about her yoga session being disturbed."
1329-3,"No, the woman's mood at the end of the video does not appear to be one of confusion or curiosity.

Her immediate reaction of getting up and running towards the man suggests she understood his action (quickly sitting down after putting the child down) and is reacting directly to it, likely with playful annoyance or mock exasperation rather than a lack of understanding. Confusion or curiosity would typically involve hesitation or a questioning expression, which are absent in her swift response."

1344-0,"Based on the video, the baby likely smiles due to a combination of factors:

The smile appears to stem from the **sudden relief** once the sharp, brief pain of the injection stops, coupled with **surprise** that the unpleasant experience was over so quickly. This leads to a rapid **cognitive reappraisal**, as suggested by the text overlays (""Is that all?"", ""It wasn't that painful after all""), where the baby processes that the event wasn't as bad as the initial shock suggested. The smile expresses this relief and changed perception, reinforced by the **shift in focus** to the parent's comforting presence and the subsequent playful interaction."
1344-1,"The baby likely smiles due to a combination of **relief** that the brief, sharp pain is over, **surprise** that the unpleasant sensation stopped so quickly, and a positive response to the **caregiver's comforting presence and playful distraction** (like bouncing) immediately following the injection. The baby seems to realize the event wasn't as bad as the initial reaction suggested, and the shift in focus to positive interaction triggers the smile."
1344-2,"Yes, the smile is a reaction signifying relief once the sharp, brief pain from the injection subsides and the baby processes that the unpleasant event is over."
1344-3,"The smile is likely a combination of relief that the painful stimulus has stopped and the underlying security the baby feels from being held. The comforting hold helped the baby regulate their emotions quickly once the pain ended, allowing the relief to manifest as a smile."
