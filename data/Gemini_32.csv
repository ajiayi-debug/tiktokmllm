0016-2,"Yes, the photo editing creates an optical illusion where the person appears to be facing both sideways (profile view) and forward (frontal view) simultaneously."
0016-0,"The person is facing to the right (profile view).

The strong silhouette formed by the forehead, nose, lips, and chin along the left edge creates a clear and distinct profile looking towards the right side of the image."
0016-7,B
0016-3,"No, we cannot conclude the person is facing forward based solely on the apparent symmetry of the shoulders. The image is an optical illusion designed to be ambiguous, presenting conflicting visual cues. The lines that might suggest symmetrical shoulders in a forward-facing interpretation also form essential parts of the profile view (like the neck, chin, or jawline). Therefore, relying on the shoulders alone ignores the equally valid profile interpretation inherent in the illusion's design."
0016-1,"The person in the image can be perceived as looking in two different directions:

1.  **Looking Forward:** Focusing on the eye, nostril, and mouth features within the silhouette suggests the person is facing and looking towards the viewer.
2.  **Looking Right:** Focusing on the outline or silhouette of the face against the background reveals a clear profile looking towards the right side of the image.

**Explanation:** This image is a well-known optical illusion. It contains visual cues that support both interpretations (frontal view and profile view). Which direction is perceived depends on which set of cues the viewer's brain emphasizes at any given moment, leading to an ambiguous or bistable perception."
0008-0,"The primary difference is that the first two people simply tap the bottle cap with an object, which has no effect. The last person performs a multi-step sequence: tapping the cap, then tapping the side/bottom of the bottle multiple times, and finally making a hand gesture, which successfully causes the cap to pop off due to the agitated carbonation."
0008-1,"The last person taps the bottle cap with a stick, similar to the first individual, but then performs an additional, distinct action: a rapid downward hand gesture in front of the bottle. This second action coincides with the Coca-Cola inside the bottle instantly and visibly freezing or turning into slush from the top down. The first two individuals only tap the cap, and their beverages show no such immediate visual transformation."
0008-7,D
0008-3,"No, the last person in the video did not open the bottle with a knife, and it is unknown if the first two people failed in their attempts.

The last person used objects like a chopstick and folded paper as part of what appears to be a magic trick or video effect, not a knife. Additionally, the video cuts away before showing the results of the first two attempts, so it cannot be confirmed whether they failed."
0008-2,"No, the last person did not use a knife.

The apparent opening of the bottle by the final person was achieved through video editing effects; the chopstick tap and hand gesture shown did not physically cause the cap to come off."
0038-0,"The cap wasn't actually snapped off easily by the person's action.

This is a visual trick achieved through video editing. The video cuts from a shot of the bottle with the cap on to a shot where the cap has been removed and replaced with an upside-down glass, timed precisely with the hand motion to create the illusion."
0038-1,"The last person was able to break off the bottle cap easily due to a combination of factors centered around applying a sharp, fast, and precisely located impact to the bottle neck.

**Brief Explanation:** Glass is a brittle material, strong under compression but weak under tension. The technique involves striking the neck sharply just below the cap. This rapid impact creates bending stress, putting the side opposite the impact under high tension. Because the impact is fast and focused (using the edge of the hand), the stress concentrates intensely at that location, exceeding the tensile strength of the glass. This initiates a crack that propagates rapidly and cleanly around the circumference of the neck due to the glass's brittleness and the sudden application of force, resulting in a clean shear. The prior tapping might help focus or potentially introduce micro-flaws, but the success hinges on the speed, force, and precision of the final strike."
0038-2,"No, the last person did not successfully break the bottle in the intended manner. The bottle shattered catastrophically, breaking well below the neck and spilling the contents, rather than having just the top portion cleanly removed."
0038-7,C
0038-3,"No, the last person did not use a lighter as a lever. The video shows the last person tapping the bottle cap with a chopstick and then using a hand motion, after which the cap comes off."
0012-1,"**Answer:** 4

**Explanation:** The video initially shows one humanoid robot figure walking. Later scenes show this same robot figure standing on a stage alongside three other distinct robot figures, bringing the total count of unique robots shown to four."
0012-3,"No, the number is different. The video initially shows one robot walking, but later scenes clearly display four distinct robot figures standing together on a stage area marked ""EX ROBOT""."
0012-2,"Yes, the video displays four robot figures in total. Initially, one robot is shown walking, and later, it is seen standing with three other distinct robot figures on a display stage."
0012-0,"**4**
Explanation: The video first shows one robot figure (white and blue suit) walking. Later, it shows a group of four figures on a stage. This group includes the initial white and blue figure, plus three additional distinct figures (silver/grey suit, black suit, red/gold suit). Therefore, there are four distinct robot figures shown in total."
0012-7,C
0036-2,"No, the thin slicing is not directly caused by the high speed itself, nor by a stroboscopic effect.

**Explanation:** Slice thickness is determined by the machine's mechanical setup, specifically the rate at which the zucchini is fed into the blade relative to the blade's rotation speed. High speed allows for efficient and clean cutting, but the feed mechanism controls how much material is presented for each cut, thus setting the thickness. The stroboscopic effect is an unrelated optical illusion concerning the perception of motion and does not influence the physical cutting process."
0036-0,"The thinness of the slices is determined by the controlled rate at which the zucchini is fed into the rotating blade, not just the blade's rotational speed. The internal feed mechanism advances the zucchini by a very small, precise amount for each pass of the cutting edge. Even if the blade appears to spin slowly, this slow, controlled advancement ensures that only a thin layer is shaved off with each cut, resulting in uniform, thin slices."
0036-1,"The machine achieves thin slices through a combination of factors:

1.  **Multiple Sharp Blades:** The rotating disc has several very sharp blades. Even if the disc itself doesn't spin incredibly fast, each revolution results in multiple slices (one per blade), significantly increasing the overall cutting frequency.
2.  **Precise Slice Gap:** The thickness of the slice is determined by the precisely engineered, fixed gap between the cutting edge of the blade and the stationary surface the zucchini rests against as it's fed.
3.  **Controlled Feed Rate:** The green conveyor belt pushes the zucchini towards the blades at a steady, controlled speed, ensuring each blade encounters the vegetable consistently for uniform slices.

Essentially, the rapid ejection of thin slices comes from the high *frequency* of cuts (RPM x number of blades) and the *precision* of the gap, rather than just extremely high rotational speed alone."
0036-7,A
0036-3,"**Answer:** Sharpness is necessary, but not sufficient on its own.

**Explanation:** A sharp blade is crucial for making clean cuts without tearing or crushing the zucchini, which is essential for achieving uniform thin slices, even at slower speeds. However, the actual thickness of the slice is primarily determined by the machine's mechanical settings (the gap controlling how much zucchini is exposed to the blade per rotation). Sharpness ensures the machine can cleanly produce the thin slice it is set for."
0037-2,"Yes, the video uses multiple edited segments and visual effects (VFX) applied over time to simulate the appearance of video game glitches.

Here's why:

1.  **Distinct Glitch Types:** The video showcases several different types of glitches sequentially (erratic object physics, T-posing, low-poly models, missing textures, character duplication, projectile multiplication). Each of these requires a specific editing technique or visual effect.
2.  **Visual Effects (VFX):** Effects like changing the character's texture to low-poly or a missing texture pattern (purple/black checkerboard), making the cup duplicate and move erratically, causing the character to T-pose, adding the ""ERROR"" text, duplicating the character, and multiplying the ping pong balls are all post-production additions.
3.  **Non-Linear Progression:** The transitions between these states (normal -> glitchy cup -> T-pose -> low-poly -> missing texture -> duplication -> multiple balls) are abrupt and clearly manipulated, not something that could occur naturally in a single take.
4.  **Compositing/Layering:** Techniques like showing a duplicate character or adding the ""ERROR"" text involve compositing different visual elements together, which is a core part of video editing.
5.  **Timing and Keyframing:** The specific timing of when each glitch appears and disappears necessitates editing software where effects can be applied to specific time segments."
0037-1,"There are **5** sections in the video showing signs of artificial editing:

1.  **0:01 - 0:05:** The red cup vibrates and jitters unnaturally on the counter, indicating added visual effects.
2.  **0:05 - 0:06:** The man freezes in a T-pose while the ping pong ball stops mid-air after being thrown, mimicking a game physics or animation glitch.
3.  **0:06 - 0:12:** The man's texture becomes pixelated, then changes to a missing texture pattern, while the cup becomes low-poly and ""ERROR"" text appears, all common visual glitch representations.
4.  **0:13 - 0:15:** A smaller duplicate of the man appears behind him in a T-pose, simulating a character rendering or duplication bug.
5.  **0:15 - 0:19:** Numerous ping pong balls suddenly appear and bounce erratically, representing an object spawning or physics engine glitch."
0037-3,"No, the video is not edited only in one part. Multiple distinct edits are applied at different points in the video to create the various glitch effects, such as the cup's erratic movement, the character T-posing, the texture changing, the appearance of an ""ERROR"" message, the character duplicating, and the balls multiplying."
0037-0,"Multiple parts of the video have been artificially edited.

**Explanation:** The video intentionally uses several distinct visual effects in sequence to simulate common video game glitches. These edits include the cup glitching, the character freezing in a T-pose, the character's appearance changing (low-poly, missing textures), the appearance of an ""ERROR"" message, a duplicate character appearing, and physics glitches like a floating ball and multiple balls spawning."

0064-2,"No, the room did not go dark because the door closing caused the lamp to fall. The lamp remained in place after the door was closed, and the room went dark due to a scene cut."
0064-1,"The lamp in the bedroom was turned off.

Explanation: Immediately after the stick figure character closed the door, the lamp, which was the only light source shown in the room, turned off. This was accompanied by a distinct 'click' sound, indicating it was switched off, causing the room to become dark."
0064-7,C
0064-0,"The room went dark after the character closed the door as a stylistic choice in the animation. It wasn't a literal turning off of the lights (as the lamp inside the room was on), but rather a visual technique used to:

1.  **Heighten Suspense and Fear:** Plunging the scene into darkness immediately emphasizes the character's feeling of being scared and alone, isolating their fearful eyes.
2.  **Create Comedic/Dramatic Effect:** The sudden, illogical darkness sets up the appearance of the scary face and the character's panicked reaction (""Mama!"") for comedic or jump-scare timing.
3.  **Employ Cartoon Logic:** Animations often use visual shorthand like this to convey a mood or transition a scene quickly, prioritizing emotional impact over strict realism."
0064-3,"No, the room did not go dark because the stick figure accidentally hit the light switch when closing the door. The animation clearly shows the character intentionally reaching out and flipping the light switch off *before* running into the next room and closing the door."
0070-0,"The person in the video poured the water **two times**.

He poured initially, paused briefly while reacting to something, and then resumed pouring a second time."
0070-1,"**Answer:** 2
**Explanation:** The video shows the person pouring water from the green M&M mug into the black revolver mug two distinct times. The first instance occurs at the beginning (approximately 00:00-00:03), and after a pause where the person reacts, they pour water again (approximately 00:08-00:13)."
0070-3,"No, the person did not pour the water only once. The video shows the person pouring water, pausing the action, and then pouring water a second time."
0070-2,"Yes.

Explanation: The video shows the person starting to pour the liquid, pausing with a surprised reaction while graphics appear, and then resuming the pour a second time."

0080-0,"The purpose of repeatedly squeezing the balloon toy is to demonstrate its primary function and key characteristic: its squishiness.

*   **Explanation:** This action showcases the successful creation of a functional squishy toy, highlighting its soft, pliable nature and demonstrating how it's meant to be interacted with, often as a stress reliever or fidget item."
0080-2,"Yes, striking the balloon is a key step in creating the final, fun toy. The impact from striking is designed to break an internal packet (containing vinegar), allowing it to mix with another substance (baking soda) already inside the balloon. This mixture causes a chemical reaction that produces gas (carbon dioxide), which inflates the balloon, bringing the toy to its intended, interactive state."
0080-3,"No, the purpose of hitting the balloon is not to make it pop loudly.

The hitting demonstrates the squishy, compressible nature of the created objects, showing that they function like stress balls or tactile toys which compress under pressure and return to their shape."
0080-1,"You need to hit the balloon to break the inner pouch containing the vinegar. This allows the vinegar to mix with the baking soda already inside the balloon, initiating a chemical reaction that produces carbon dioxide gas and inflates the balloon."
0080-7,A
0081-3,"No, the man putting his hand on his face was not part of a synchronized dance move. It appears to be an isolated action, distinct from the woman's dance movements occurring simultaneously."
0081-1,"The video does not provide an explanation for why the man covers his face with his hand. There are no visual cues, dialogue, or text within the clip that clarify the reason for this specific gesture before he points to the woman."
0081-0,"The man briefly puts his hand on his face possibly as a quick, reflexive action upon starting the recording, perhaps to compose his expression, reset mentally before performing, or simply as a transitional movement before making the first intended gesture."
0081-7,D
0081-2,"No, the man did not cover his face to transfer the filter. The digital cat ear filter remains consistently on the woman's face throughout the video and never appears on the man. The man briefly covers his lower face before pointing at the woman and joining her dance."
0083-1,"The daughter's repeated entries serve to reveal the humorous contrast between the mother's initial strong rejection of the dog and her subsequent, hidden affection and doting behavior towards it when she believes she is unobserved. Each entry acts as a snapshot, allowing the daughter (and the audience) to witness the mother's true feelings develop, exposing the difference between her words and actions and reinforcing the comedic trope of the initially unwilling parent becoming attached to the pet."
0083-0,"The daughter repeatedly entering or peeking into the room serves as the primary way for both her and the audience to discover the mother's hypocrisy. Each entrance reveals a new layer of the mother's hidden affection for the dog, contrasting sharply with her initial harsh rejection. This repetition builds comedic tension, highlights the difference between the mother's words and actions when she thinks she's alone, and ultimately exposes her true feelings towards the pet."
0083-3,"Yes, the video depicts a scenario where an initially disapproving Asian mother is later caught by her daughter repeatedly interacting affectionately with the new pet dog, playing on cultural stereotypes about initial resistance to pets followed by doting behavior."
0083-2,"Yes, the daughter is intentionally trying to uncover her mother's true feelings about the pet dog. Her actions, such as listening at the door after being told to take the dog away, repeatedly entering the room when she hears her mother speaking affectionately to the dog, and pretending to leave while actually peeking, clearly show she suspects her mother's hidden fondness and is deliberately trying to observe and confirm it."

0099-1,"There are 4 zoomed-in close-ups in the video.

Brief explanation: The video cuts to a magnified view of the pattern being drawn at approximately 0:09, shifts to another close-up view at 0:13, zooms in again near the center at 0:54, and shifts to a final close-up view at 0:57."
0099-0,"There are **3** zoomed-in close-ups throughout the video.

1.  Around 0:10, the view zooms in towards the center of the developing pattern.
2.  Around 0:14, there is a quick zoom focusing on the moving point tracing the pattern.
3.  Starting around 0:54, the view zooms in significantly on the moving point for the final part of the visualization."
0099-3,"No, the video does not contain 10 zoomed-in close-ups. It features six distinct zoomed-in close-ups focusing on the geometric pattern at different stages of its formation."
0099-2,"Yes, there are two zoomed-in close-ups in the video focusing on aspects of the geometric pattern.

**Explanation:**
The first zoom occurs around the 0:09 mark, enlarging the view to better show the intricate overlapping curves as the pattern develops. A second, much more extreme zoom happens near the end, around 0:55, focusing very closely on the moving point and the lines immediately around it."

0101-0,"The sequence of locations where the man appears is:

1.  **Doorway:** He initially stands in the doorway holding a blanket.
2.  **Behind Bookshelf:** He briefly appears behind the doors of a bookshelf/cabinet unit.
3.  **Inside Sofa:** He pops up from within the structure of the sofa.
4.  **Inside Cardboard Box:** He peeks out from inside a cardboard box on the floor.
5.  **Near Doorway:** He reappears kneeling on the floor near the original doorway, under the blanket.

**Explanation:** The video uses editing to create the illusion of teleportation. The man starts in the doorway, then is shown in quick succession hiding behind the bookshelf, inside the sofa, inside the box, and finally revealing himself near the doorway where he started."
0101-2,"No, the man does not actually teleport. The video uses clever editing techniques, such as jump cuts and visual effects (like the breaking bookshelf), to create the *illusion* that he is instantly moving between the bookshelf, couch, cardboard box, and finally reappearing under the blanket. These are visual tricks common in video production, not real teleportation."
0101-1,"The order of locations where the man appears after teleporting is:

1.  **Behind the Bookshelf:** He first pops out from behind the built-in bookshelf unit.
2.  **Inside the Sofa:** Next, he reveals himself from within the sofa's storage compartment.
3.  **Inside the Box:** Then, he peeks out from inside a cardboard box.
4.  **Behind the Box:** Finally, he emerges from behind the same cardboard box."
0101-3,"No.

The man first hides behind a blanket, then appears via an effect behind the bookshelf, then physically hides inside the couch, then inside the cardboard box, and finally reappears from under the blanket near the doorway. The order presented in the question (bookshelf -> box -> couch) is incorrect."

0113-3,"No.

**Brief Explanation:**
The video shows multiple demolition events involving different structures. These include the controlled implosion of a tall, glass-facade building, the demolition of a brick water tower by an excavator, and the dismantling or collapse of a large metal structure from a height."
0113-2,"No, the video shows the demolition of one tall skyscraper and one brick water tower."
0113-1,"There is **one** building taken down in the video.

**Explanation:** The video shows the demolition of a tall skyscraper (0:30-0:38), which is a building. Other large structures like a water tower (0:55-0:59) and a large metal component (0:40-0:49) are also taken down, but these are not typically classified as buildings in the same sense as the skyscraper."
0113-0,"**One** building is demolished throughout the video.

**Explanation:**
The video shows the controlled implosion of one tall skyscraper (0:30-0:38). Other scenes show the destruction of a washing machine, a large industrial structure/smokestack being dismantled, and a water tower being knocked down, which are not typically classified as buildings in the same sense as the skyscraper."

0118-1,"The person pushed the three blue plastic bottles with their hand. This action applied forward force, causing the bottles to roll off the concrete ledge."
0118-0,"He pushed the bottles forward along the concrete ledge with his hand, causing them to slide off the end."
0118-2,"No, the person did not let go of the bottles on a slope. The video shows the person actively pushing the bottles horizontally along the top of a flat, level concrete ledge. The transition to the next scene occurs while the bottles are sliding along this flat surface, not falling down a slope."
0118-3,"It is unclear from the video if the person intentionally pushed the bottle or if their hand merely touched it as it started rolling. While contact is made between the hand and the bottle just before it rolls, the visual information isn't sufficient to confirm the intent behind the contact."

**Explanation:** This demonstrates coordinated motion and timing, applying principles of physics related to individual trajectories, momentum, and the precise sequencing required to pass through a fixed aperture without collision."
0133-2,Yes. The final scene shows three men jumping simultaneously while one of them maneuvers a hula hoop over and around all three of them as they are in the air.
0133-1,"Three men are shown jumping simultaneously through a large, rolling hula hoop inside a gymnasium. This demonstrates coordination and timing, likely related to understanding the motion of the hoop and their own jumps."

**Explanation:** He does this to visually demonstrate how much dirt and grime accumulates on the frequently touched surface of the moving handrail. By holding the initially clean tissue against the rail, it picks up the residue, making the invisible dirt visible and highlighting the need for hygiene awareness in public spaces."
0142-0,"The character in the costume is using a white *tissue* or *wipe*, not tape.

The purpose is to demonstrate that this specific escalator handrail is clean.

*Brief Explanation:* By holding the clean tissue against the moving handrail for an extended period and then showing that it remains clean, the character provides visual proof of the handrail's hygiene. This contrasts with the initial dirty wipe shown (or the common expectation of dirty handrails) and suggests this particular escalator has an effective cleaning or sanitization system in place, reassuring users of its cleanliness."
0142-2,"The purpose of the character in the Spider-Man costume putting the white wipe (not tape) on the escalator handrail is to **visually demonstrate how dirty the high-touch surface is, even if it appears clean.**

**Brief Explanation:** By holding the initially clean wipe against the moving handrail, the character collects the accumulated grime. Showing the now-dirty wipe serves as tangible proof of surface contamination, highlighting the potential presence of dirt and germs on frequently touched public objects and promoting awareness about the importance of hand hygiene (like washing or sanitizing hands) after contact."
0142-3,"No, a small piece of white tape is not attached to the armrest.

**Explanation:** The video shows a hand and later Spider-Man's hand wiping the black rubber handrail directly with a white tissue. The black residue comes off the handrail itself onto the tissue; there is no visible tape involved in the process shown."

They are temporary tools employed during the book folding art process to hold the folded sections securely in place, maintain tension, and keep the structure compact while the artist works on folding subsequent pages."
0152-2,"No, the blue items seen in the video are not retainers used to permanently fix the pages.

They are blue elastic bands used as a temporary tool during the book folding process.

Explanation: The video compilation shows the golfer successfully hitting 11 different targets, including a bell, eggs, a candle flame, a balloon, a golf ball on a tee, a glass, a lightbulb, and a chocolate orange. Each distinct successful shot is counted."
0162-7,E
0162-3,"Yes, the golfer successfully hits the target in all 11 clips shown in the montage."
0162-2,"No. The video shows the golfer successfully hitting the target in each of the multiple trick shot segments presented, not just once."
0162-0,"The golfer successfully hits the target 11 times.

The video shows the golfer accurately striking a variety of objects placed on tees or stands, including a bell, eggs, a candle (extinguishing the flame), a balloon, a golf ball, a glass of Guinness, a lightbulb, and a chocolate orange."
0167-0,"The woman is surprised because the man performs a magic trick where it appears that a solid wooden stick passes straight through his closed fists. He initially holds the stick *between* his fists, and then, after a moment, opens his hands to reveal the stick resting *across* his open palms, creating an illusion that defies physical expectations."
0167-1,"The woman feels astonished because the man's hand movements created a convincing illusion that he was snapping the wooden stick within his closed fists. She expected the stick to be broken due to his apparent effort and gestures, but when he opened his hands, the stick was revealed completely intact, directly contradicting the expectation he had built up."
0167-7,B
0167-2,"Yes, the woman is surprised because the wooden stick remains unbroken. The man pretends to exert significant force to break it, leading her to expect it to snap, so she is surprised when he reveals it is still intact."
0167-3,"No, the woman is surprised because the man *failed* to break the object, which appears to be a wooden craft stick, not a pencil. Her surprise comes from the stick remaining intact after his attempt."
0169-0,"The woman pours juice into the mold **two** times.

First, she pours an orange-colored juice into one mold (around 0:08-0:12), and then she pours a red-colored juice into another mold (around 0:13-0:15)."
0169-7,A
0169-1,"**2 times**

**Explanation:**
The woman fills a mold with orange juice once (around 0:08-0:12) and then fills another mold with red juice once (around 0:13-0:15). The other actions shown involve removing already frozen popsicles from their molds."
0169-2,"Yes, the woman pours liquid into the molds twice in the video. First, she pours an orange liquid into one empty mold, and shortly after, she pours a red liquid into a different empty mold."
0169-3,**Fewer:** The woman pours liquid into the molds only two times in the video: once with orange liquid (around 0:10) and once with red liquid (around 0:14).
0198-0,"There are **12** photos/scenes about ""old me"" played in the video.

**Explanation:**
The video displays a sequence of different images and short clips while the text ""Old me:"" is on screen. Counting each distinct visual scene shown during this segment results in a total of 12."
0198-2,"Yes, that is accurate. The video shows 12 distinct clips or images labeled ""Old me:"" in the first 12 seconds."
0198-7,A
0198-3,"No, the scene of 'old me' reading a book at a desk is shown only one time."
0198-1,"There are 12 photos labeled 'old me' shown in the video. This is determined by counting each distinct image that appears with the text ""Old me:"" before the video transitions to images labeled ""now me:""."

Explanation: The person makes one complete cut to sever the banana stalk from the plant, although it takes multiple swings with the machete to achieve this."
0179-1,"The stems have been cut **2** times.

First, the stem holding the bunch of bananas was cut to harvest the fruit. Second, the main trunk (pseudostem) of the banana plant was cut down."
0179-2,No. The person uses a machete to strike the thick banana stem multiple times before it is fully cut.
0179-3,"Yes.
Explanation: The person in the video strikes the banana stem with a machete exactly 10 times, causing it to break and allowing the banana bunch to be harvested."
0217-2,"Yes, based on the clock's readings shown in the video, the demonstration spans one hour and fifteen minutes.

**Explanation:** The clock face indicates a starting time of approximately 10:10 and an ending time of approximately 11:25. Calculating the difference between these times (11:25 - 10:10) results in 1 hour and 15 minutes. This is the duration of the process *as depicted by the clock* in the sped-up segment."
0217-7,B
0217-0,"The time lapse lasted for 6 seconds.

It starts at the 00:09 mark when the clock appears and ends at the 00:15 mark when the clock disappears."
0217-1,"The exact duration of the capillary action demonstration shown in the sped-up segment of the video, when converted to real time, is approximately **40 seconds**.

**Explanation:** The video indicates that the capillary action segment is shown at ""x8 Speed"". This segment lasts roughly 5 seconds on screen (from approximately 0:09 to 0:14). To find the real-time duration, we multiply the observed duration by the speed factor: 5 seconds * 8 = 40 seconds."
0217-3,"**No**, the time lapse did not last precisely 2 hours.

**Explanation:** The clock in the video is likely a prop used to visually indicate the passage of a significant amount of time (approximately two hours). However, we cannot confirm its accuracy or that the experiment started and ended at the exact moments the clock indicated 10:00 and 12:00. Factors like potential clock inaccuracy, imprecise reading from the video, and editing choices make it highly unlikely the duration was *precisely* two hours. The clock serves an illustrative purpose rather than acting as a precise measurement tool for the experiment's duration."
0242-1,"The two orange cats leaped away because the person wearing a grey hoodie, approaching from the left, made a sudden movement towards them and simultaneously created an abrupt noise. This sudden action startled the cats, causing them to jump off the counter in fright."
0242-0,"The two orange cats jumped away because the person suddenly thrust their hand forward towards them.

**Explanation:** Cats are sensitive to sudden movements. The quick, unexpected approach of the person's hand towards the cats on the countertop startled them, triggering their natural flight response, causing them to leap away."
0242-2,"Yes, the two orange cats jumped away because the person in the red hat used a party blower.

**Explanation:** The sudden, loud noise produced by the party blower startled both cats, triggering a flight response which caused them to immediately jump off the counter."
0242-3,"No, the two orange cats did not jump away because they were frightened by a toy snake.

The video shows a clip (around 0:17) where two orange cats jump off a counter, but they are startled by a person's sudden action, not by a toy snake. While other clips in the compilation show cats reacting to toy snakes, that specific scenario involving the two orange cats on the counter does not occur."

0248-1,"The person in the foreground is painting a detail onto a large artwork. They are using a fine brush to apply a small amount of white paint, creating a highlight on the bridge of the nose in a hyperrealistic portrait that features a wet effect with water droplets."
0248-2,"Yes. The video shows an artist using a fine brush to apply paint to a large-scale portrait of a woman. The painting exhibits an extremely high level of detail, particularly in the rendering of water droplets on the subject's skin and hair, which is characteristic of the hyperrealistic style."
0248-0,"The person in the foreground is an artist meticulously painting a highlight onto a hyperrealistic portrait of a woman's face. They are using a very fine brush to add a small detail, likely representing a water droplet or reflection, onto the bridge of the nose in the painting, enhancing the illusion of wetness on the subject's skin."
0248-3,"No, the person is not under running water. The video shows an artist's hand meticulously painting a highlight onto one of the water droplets on the face, indicating that the droplets are part of a static, hyperrealistic artwork, not actual, currently flowing water."
0248-7,B
0251-7,D
0251-3,"Yes, the ball fell off the disc because the disc was tilted. This tilting created an inclined surface, and the force of gravity pulled the ball downwards along this incline, causing it to roll towards the edge and eventually fall off."
0251-2,"No, the ball did not fall off because it was thrown. The fall is a direct consequence of the artwork's mechanics; the movements of the figures underneath cause the table to tilt. Gravity then acts on the ball, causing it to roll down the inclined surface towards the edge and eventually fall off."
0251-1,"The upward movement of one or more of the mechanical figures supporting the disc causes the disc to tilt significantly. Gravity then pulls the ball down the resulting slope towards the lower edge, causing it to roll off when the tilt is pronounced enough."
0251-0,"The ball approaches the edge of the disc because the movement of the figures underneath causes the disc to tilt. This tilting creates an inclined plane, and gravity pulls the ball down this slope towards the lowest point, which is the edge."
0256-2,"No, the ping-pong ball does not bounce 17 times on the ground before entering the cup. It bounces 13 times (12 times on the stair treads and 1 time on the landing) before going into the cup."
0256-1,"The ping-pong ball bounces 15 times.

Explanation: By carefully watching the video and listening to the sound, we can count each time the orange ping-pong ball makes contact with a surface (the stairs or the floor at the bottom) as it descends."
0256-3,"Yes, the ping-pong ball bounces 15 times. This count includes the bounces on the stair treads as it descends and the subsequent bounces on the landing floor before it enters the glass."
0256-7,A
0256-0,"The ping-pong ball bounces 13 times in total.

**Explanation:** The ball bounces 11 times on the individual stair steps, followed by one bounce on the flat landing area at the bottom, and a final, thirteenth bounce occurs inside the cup."
0259-0,The man did not throw his hat in the video. He threw a miniature golf club using his right hand.
0259-3,"No, the man did not throw his hat. The video shows the man throwing a miniature golf club with his right hand after missing a putt."
0259-1,The man did not discard his hat. He is seen wearing the black baseball cap throughout the entire video clip.
0259-2,"No, the man did not use his left hand to throw away his hat after failing to score.

The man kept his baseball cap on his head throughout the entire video clip, even during his moments of frustration after missing the putts. He did throw the miniature club, but not his hat."
0259-7,D
0266-1,"The yellow rubber band is not completely wrapped around either thumb.

Throughout the video, the rubber band is consistently stretched between the thumb and the index finger of the right hand, acting as anchor points for the manipulation, rather than being fully encircled around just the thumb."
0266-0,The yellow rubber band is not fully looped around *only* a thumb at any point in the video. It is consistently looped around both the right thumb and the right index finger.
0266-7,C
0266-3,"No. The rubber band is always stretched between the right thumb and the right index finger, or manipulated by the left hand; it does not form an isolated loop solely around the right thumb at any point in the video."
0266-2,"No, the yellow rubber band is not fully looped around the left thumb in a stable or final way. The loop around the left thumb is a temporary part of the manipulation; upon release, the band snaps back to its original position on the right hand."
0267-3,"No, the people in the video are not genuinely jumping or leaping in the air as depicted. The video utilizes forced perspective, an optical illusion technique, to create these effects. This involves careful positioning of subjects and the camera to manipulate the viewer's perception of size, distance, and gravity, making it seem like people are interacting with their environment in impossible ways (like jumping extremely high, holding distant objects, or appearing headless)."
0267-0,"The first person in the video appears to be hanging or suspended from the white line painted on the court. This is an optical illusion created using forced perspective; the image is taken from a high angle looking down, making the flat ground appear as a vertical surface from which he is hanging."
0267-2,"Yes, the person is creating an illusion by lying on the basketball court. The overhead camera angle removes normal depth cues, and the person's pose makes it appear as though they are hanging from the white line painted on the court surface."
0267-1,"**Creating a Forced Perspective Illusion.**

**Explanation:** The person has jumped into the air and timed their pose, positioning their hand near the painted line on the court. Due to the overhead camera angle, this creates the visual illusion that they are hanging from the line."
0267-7,C
0273-7,B
0273-2,"No, the video does not provide a clear view of the top face of the solved Rubik's Cube. The camera angle and the way the cube is held obscure the top surface, making it impossible to determine its color from the footage."
0273-1,"The color on the top face of the Rubik's Cube after it is solved is **White**.

**Explanation:** Around the 0:09 mark in the video, the person holds up the completed Rubik's Cube, clearly showing the white face oriented upwards as the top face."
0273-0,"Yellow is facing up.

Explanation: In the video clip, when the person looks up while holding the Rubik's Cube, the top face predominantly displays the color yellow, although the cube itself is not solved at that moment."
0273-3,"No, the top color of the solved Rubik's Cube is not yellow.

Explanation: The video clearly shows that the top face of the Rubik's Cube is white when it is solved."
0274-0,"**5**

**Explanation:** There are 5 distinct dancers visible in the video clip. The video begins with four dancers, and a fifth dancer enters from the left side shortly after, bringing the total count to five individuals performing the choreography."
0274-1,"There are five individuals visible in the video. One dancer is in the center foreground, and four other dancers are performing behind him."
0274-2,"**Answer:** No
**Explanation:** Throughout the video clip, there are consistently five dancers visible: one central dancer and four supporting dancers in the background. Camera angles and movements do not reveal any additional individuals to reach a total of seven."
0274-3,"No, the total number of people visible in the video frames is not six. There are five individuals dancing in the studio."
0274-7,D
0276-3,"Yes, the illusion is created solely through physical techniques without video editing. It relies on a combination of skillful drawing, careful paper cutting, and folding. The effect is achieved through anamorphic drawing and paper manipulation, viewed from a specific camera angle to create a forced perspective. The pencil moving ""behind"" the drawn cube and the final lifting of the paper reveal the physical cut-and-fold construction responsible for the optical trick."
0276-1,"The illusion is created using a combination of techniques:

1.  **Cut Paper:** The paper around the top and front-facing sides of the drawn cube is physically cut away, creating a real gap.
2.  **Anamorphic Drawing (Forced Perspective):** The cube is drawn using distorted perspective so that it appears as a convincing 3D object only from the specific camera angle.
3.  **Strategic Shadow:** A shadow is drawn on the main sheet of paper directly below the cut-out, enhancing the illusion that the cube is elevated off the surface.
4.  **Camera Angle:** The illusion is highly dependent on the specific viewpoint, which hides the cut edges and makes the distorted drawing appear correctly proportioned.

The pencil does not actually pass *under* the drawing; it passes through the physical gap created by cutting the paper, behind the portion of the drawing that remains. The drawing, shadow, and camera angle trick the viewer into perceiving the drawn cube as a solid object raised above the page."
0276-2,"No, the illusion does not rely on video editing effects like masking. The effect is achieved solely through the physical arrangement of the paper and the specific camera angle. The paper is cut and folded in a way that, combined with the perspective of the drawing, creates the appearance of a three-dimensional cube, allowing the pencil to pass behind the raised portion of the paper without any digital manipulation."
0276-0,"No, there are no apparent video editing *visual* effects used to help make the illusion believable.

**Explanation:**

The illusion is created using physical techniques:
1.  **Anamorphic Drawing:** The cube is drawn in a distorted way on the paper so it appears three-dimensional only when viewed from a specific angle.
2.  **Cut and Folded Paper:** Part of the paper is cut and folded upwards to create the vertical sides of the ""cube,"" giving it actual physical height relative to the flat surface where the top and shadow are drawn.
3.  **Camera Angle:** The video is filmed from a precise angle where the drawing and the folded paper align to form the image of a solid cube.
4.  **Physical Interaction:** The pencil moving ""behind"" the cube and the hand lifting the folded paper are real interactions with the physical setup, demonstrating how the illusion works without digital manipulation."

0278-1,"**Black and Red:** The initial problem statement ""Factor the polynomial. 3x³ + x² - 15x - 5"" is printed in black. The subsequent steps showing the factoring process are handwritten using a red marker."
0278-2,"Yes, the writing on the paper in the video is orange. The handwritten steps showing the factorization of the polynomial `3x³ + x² - 15x - 5` are written with an orange marker."
0278-3,"Yes, the writing added during the factoring process is orange/red. The video shows a hand using an orange marker to write the steps for factoring the polynomial, and the ink appears orange/red on the paper."
0278-7,C
0278-0,"The writing on the paper in the video is in two colors:

1.  **Black Ink:** The initial problem statement ""Factor the polynomial."" and the polynomial itself ""3x³ + x² - 15x - 5"" are written in black ink.
    *   **Explanation:** This text is already on the paper at the start and is clearly black.
2.  **Red Ink:** All the steps written by the hand using the orange marker during the factorization process are in red (or reddish-orange) ink.
    *   **Explanation:** The video shows the hand using a marker that produces red/orange ink to write out the solution steps."
0288-2,"No. The video does not feature a knife with a darker black steel part. The only knife shown and used throughout the video is a large cleaver with a standard silver-colored steel blade. While this cleaver performs well on most tasks, it does encounter difficulty when the woman attempts to slice through tough pork belly skin near the end of the video."
0288-3,"No. The video exclusively shows a dark cleaver being used for various cutting demonstrations and does not feature a lighter silver steel knife at all. Consequently, the video provides no evidence or basis for comparison regarding the ease of use of a lighter silver steel knife."
0288-1,"The cleaver in the video is difficult to use when cutting the thick slab of pork skin/fat. This is because the material is tough, fatty, and pliable, making it resistant to the cleaver's chopping motion, which works better on hard, brittle items or easily sheared materials."
0288-7,C
0288-0,"The large cleaver shown in the video.

**Explanation:** While the cleaver cuts through most items effortlessly (bone, bottle, paper, cloth), it proves difficult to use when cutting the pork belly. The toughness of the pork skin requires the user (the woman) to apply significant pressure with two hands, and the cut is not as clean or swift compared to the other demonstrations, indicating difficulty in using the knife for that specific material."
0291-0,"The rotational movement of the metal rod is caused by **Ion Wind** (also known as Electric Wind or Electrohydrodynamic Thrust).

**Explanation:** The high voltage from the Tesla coil concentrates at the sharp, bent tips of the metal rod. This strong electric field ionizes the surrounding air molecules. These newly formed ions, having the same polarity as the tip, are strongly repelled and accelerated away. According to Newton's Third Law (action-reaction), as the ions are pushed away from the tips, an equal and opposite force pushes the tips backward. Because the tips are bent, this reaction force creates a torque, causing the rod to spin."
0291-2,"No, the initial rotation did not start because a human plucked it.

The rotation begins automatically as soon as the metal object is placed on the central electrode and electrical arcs start discharging from the electrode to the tips of the object. The force exerted by this electrical discharge (often referred to as ion wind or electric wind) pushes the object, causing it to spin."
0291-3,"No, the rotational movement was not caused *solely* by the interaction between the electric field and the metal rod.

**Explanation:** The rotation is primarily driven by **ion wind** (also known as electric wind). The strong electric field from the Tesla coil ionizes the air molecules near the sharp tips of the rotating metal structure (corona discharge). The electric field then pushes these ions away from the tips. According to Newton's Third Law, this action of pushing the ions away creates an equal and opposite reaction force on the tips, causing the structure to rotate. Therefore, the interaction with the surrounding air is crucial for the rotation."
0291-1,"The rotational movement of the metal rod (spinner) was initiated by the force generated from electrical arc discharges forming at its sharp tips. The high voltage supplied by the device caused the air around the tips to ionize, creating plasma arcs.

The rotation continued because these discharges were sustained by the continuous high-voltage supply. The expulsion of ions and electrons from the tips, often referred to as ""ion wind"" or electric wind, created a continuous reaction force (Newton's Third Law). This force acted tangentially on the tips, generating a constant torque that overcame friction and air resistance, keeping the rod spinning."

0292-0,"It is not possible to determine the number of vehicles directly behind the bus from the video.

**Explanation:** As the bus passes the camera, its size and position block the view of the road immediately behind it, making it impossible to see if any vehicles are following closely."
0292-1,"It is **not possible** to determine the exact number of vehicles following the bus from this long-exposure photograph.

**Explanation:**
The long-exposure technique used captures the movement of lights over time, creating streaks. Headlights and taillights from any vehicles moving during the exposure merge into these streaks, making it impossible to distinguish individual vehicles or count how many were following the bus."
0292-3,"No, the video and the resulting photograph show only one vehicle, a red car, following the bus. The long exposure captures distinct light trails from both the bus and this single red car."
0292-2,No. The final long exposure photograph shows red light trails (from taillights) extending behind the main light trails left by the bus. These additional streaks indicate that multiple vehicles were following the bus and were captured during the exposure.
0295-1,"**One technique.**

The person consistently used a single method: tilting the yellow bag downwards over the bottle opening and squeezing the bag to force the contents out."
0295-0,"One method was tried.

The person holding the yellow bag only used the method of pouring the contents from the bag into the squeeze bottle."
0295-2,"Yes, the person consistently squeezed the bag to pour the substance, both into the narrow tip and the wider opening after the tip was removed. The squeezing technique itself remained the same."
0295-7,B
0295-3,"No, the person with the yellow bag did not try three methods.

**Explanation:** The person first attempted to pour the contents into the small nozzle of the bottle. When this proved difficult, another person removed the entire cap, and the first person then poured the contents into the wider opening. Only two methods were used."
0303-2,"No, the man does not stop cycling by jumping off his bike and crashing into a cushion.

He successfully lands the trick on the ramp, rides down onto the flat ground, dismounts his bike, and then runs and jumps onto the cushion as part of his celebration. The bike stops separately on the ground where he dismounted."
0303-0,"He lands the trick on the inflatable ramp and immediately jumps off the bicycle, letting it fall onto the ramp surface as he runs forward to celebrate."
0303-3,"Yes, the man stops cycling by dismounting and walking away.

After successfully landing the aerial trick on the inflatable ramp, the rider stops the bike, lets it fall to the side, and walks away from it to celebrate."
0303-1,"The man dismounts the bike after landing his trick and riding down the inflatable ramp. He steps off while the bike is still moving slowly, letting it fall to the ground as he runs forward to celebrate."
0303-7,C
0296-2,"Yes, the reason the man appears to miss the large blue pants is due to a visual illusion.

The scene uses forced perspective, where miniature jeans are placed much closer to the camera and aligned with the larger jeans hanging further in the background. The man intentionally grabs the miniature jeans, creating the illusion that he was reaching for the large ones and they somehow shrunk."
0296-7,C
0296-3,"No. The man doesn't catch the original blue pants because a visual effect is employed. The scene uses video editing or a sleight-of-hand trick to instantly replace the large hanging pants with a small, flat prop representing shrunken jeans as his hand reaches them. This creates a planned illusion for the video, rather than the pants being an uncatchable painted object."
0296-1,The man misses catching the full-sized blue pants because they instantly shrink into a miniature version as soon as he grabs them off the clothesline.
0296-0,"The man successfully grabs the blue pants off the clothesline on his first attempt. However, as he pulls them towards himself, they appear to instantly shrink into a tiny object in his hand due to a visual effect or editing trick used for the video shoot."
0304-0,"One layer.

**Explanation:**
The video shows the person writing the equation ""128√e980"" directly onto a single, unfolded sheet of paper. The paper is only folded *after* the writing is complete to reveal the hidden message ""I Love you"". Therefore, the writing itself was performed on just one layer."
0304-1,"One sheet. The video shows the person writing the initial equation ""128√e980"" entirely on a single piece of paper before it is manipulated to reveal the message."
0304-2,"No. The video shows the person writing on a single sheet of paper that is later folded along the drawn horizontal line to reveal the message ""I Love you""."
0304-3,"No, the person does not initially write on just one layer of paper.

**Explanation:** The writing is done across a visible horizontal line, which is the edge where two separate pieces of paper are aligned together from the beginning. This allows the top piece to be lifted cleanly to reveal the message."
0304-7,D
0308-0,"The first military aircraft is executing a low altitude approach turn.

**Explanation:** The fighter jet is seen approaching the aircraft carrier at a low altitude and then performs a sharp turn maneuver near the vessel's flight deck."
0308-2,"No, the aircraft is performing a wave-off, which is an intentional abort of the landing attempt *before* touching down. This is typically done if the approach is unstable, the deck is not clear, or instructed by the Landing Signal Officer (LSO). It is not a failed landing (like a bolter, where the aircraft touches down but misses the arresting wires) but a standard safety procedure."
0308-1,"The initial military aircraft is performing an extremely **high angle-of-attack (high-alpha) pull-up maneuver** just before reaching the aircraft carrier deck, resembling **Pugachev's Cobra**.

*   **Explanation:** Instead of maintaining a stable descent on a glide path typical for landing, the jet abruptly pitches its nose almost vertically upwards while still moving forward over the deck. This is not a standard landing technique but rather an aerodynamic demonstration or a non-standard fly-by, showcasing the aircraft's maneuverability at high angles of attack."
0308-3,"No, the first military aircraft shown is not taking off from the aircraft carrier.

The aircraft is seen approaching the carrier from the front and then executing a steep climb *before* reaching the flight deck. Standard carrier takeoffs involve accelerating along the deck (often using a catapult or ski jump) and becoming airborne *after* leaving the end of the deck, not climbing vertically before reaching it. The maneuver shown is inconsistent with a takeoff procedure and looks more like an approach followed by a sharp climb or a display maneuver."

0313-0,"**9**

**Explanation:** The video concludes by showing the 3x3 white shelving unit fully stocked, with products visible in all nine individual cube compartments."
0313-3,"**No**, the products do not occupy 10 compartments. The shelf unit shown in the video is a 3x3 grid with only 9 compartments, and while all 9 compartments contain products at the end, there isn't a 10th compartment on this shelf."
0313-2,"Yes, the products occupy 9 compartments on the shelf at the end of the video.

**Explanation:** The final scene shows a 3x3 grid section of the white shelving unit, and each of these nine compartments is filled with various products, creating a complete retail-style display in that area."
0313-7,B
0313-1,"By the end of the video, **9** sections on the shelf are filled with products.

**Explanation:** The video shows the process of stocking a 3x3 cube shelf, and by the final shot, every one of the nine main compartments contains various skincare and bath products, creating a complete retail display."
0319-0,"The ball is in the person's hand.

Explanation: After the ball rolls out of the circular track and comes to a stop on the table near the diagram, the person picks it up. The video ends with the ball being held in the person's hand above the table surface."
0319-1,"**Answer:** Path C.

**Explanation:** Due to inertia (Newton's First Law), once the constraining force of the circular track is removed at the exit point, the ball continues to move in a straight line. This straight line path is tangent to the circular path the ball was following at the moment it exited the track."
0319-3,"No.

The ball does not end up at position A. When the ring is removed, the inward force constraining the ball to a circular path disappears. According to Newton's First Law (inertia), the ball continues to move in a straight line tangent to the circle at the point of release. This straight path corresponds to C on the diagram, not the curved path A."
0319-2,"No. The ball exits the track along path C and is picked up by the person, but the video ends before the track is reassembled or the ball is placed back inside."
0319-7,D
0320-2,"No, the last person in the video does not stand on a pole to jump onto the tire.

He jumps towards and grabs the horizontal bar, swings on it, and then performs a backflip off the bar, landing on the sand near the tire. He does not use the vertical poles as a platform, nor does he jump onto the tire."
0320-0,"He performs a running backflip over the horizontal bar.

**Explanation:** He runs towards the low bar, grabs it with both hands, and uses his forward momentum combined with a pull on the bar and a tight tuck of his body to initiate a backward rotation (backflip) over the obstacle, releasing the bar mid-air before landing on his feet in the sand."
0320-1,"The last person uses a **Tucked Backflip** (also known as a Flyaway) to jump off the bar.

**Explanation:** He swings on the horizontal bar to build momentum, then releases his grip, rotates backward in the air while pulling his knees towards his chest (tucking), completing a full flip before landing."
0320-3,"No, the last person does not perform a parkour move to jump over a fence. In the final clip, he performs a backflip off a yellow horizontal bar, landing on the sand."
0320-7,B
0321-3,"No, the people in the group are not playing a game of rock, paper, scissors. They are performing a choreographed sequence of hand gestures, indicated by the synchronized movements and the inclusion of gestures like the finger heart, which are not part of the standard game."
0321-7,A
0321-0,"The group of people are engaging in a synchronized hand gesture sequence.

They start with their hands formed into fists, then simultaneously change to a 'peace' sign, and finally transition together into a 'finger heart' gesture, all arranged in a circle pointing inwards against the sky."
0321-2,"Yes. The video shows multiple people performing synchronized hand gestures in a circle, indicating a planned choreography being filmed."
0321-1,"The people in the group are performing a **Coordinated Group Hand Gesture Sequence**.

**Explanation:** They are standing in a circle and synchronously changing their hand gestures in a specific order: starting with fists, transitioning to peace signs, and finally forming finger hearts, all performed together against the sky."
0325-3,No. The rider performed significantly more than three aerial maneuvers while crossing the obstacles; the sequence shown includes seven distinct aerial tricks executed over various jumps and features.
0325-0,"The rider executes 7 distinct jumps in the air while crossing obstacles. During 4 of these jumps, the rider also performs a flipping maneuver (such as a backflip, frontflip, or cashroll)."
0325-1,"The rider performs 5 flips and a total of 8 major aerial maneuvers (jumps with tricks) while navigating the obstacles.

**Explanation:** The rider executes a sequence of complex tricks during jumps off various ramps and features. These include flips like Cash Rolls, a Flair, a Backflip Barspin, and a Front Flip No Hander, totaling 5 flips. Other significant aerial maneuvers performed during jumps include Tailwhips and 360 spins, bringing the total count of major aerial tricks/jumps to 8."
0325-2,"Yes, it is true that the rider performed eight major tricks involving jumps or flips while crossing the obstacles. The run included distinct aerial maneuvers off each significant ramp or feature, such as flips, rotations (like 360s, Flairs, Cash Rolls), and combinations (like Backflip Barspins), culminating in eight key tricks before the final manual."
0325-7,B
0334-3,"No, the scene is not real. It's a digitally manipulated or created image representing a concept, as a giant pencil cannot physically erase roads to create a path."
0334-0,"**Image:** Pencil erasing roads to create a path for a person.
**Explanation:** This image appears to be digitally manipulated or an illustration. The effect of a pencil eraser clearing a path through a complex network of roads, leaving a clean white space, is not achievable through forced perspective alone and suggests digital editing or creation."
0334-2,"Yes, the scene with the pencil erasing the road is a digitally created image.

The maze of roads appears to be a graphic illustration rather than a photograph of a real location or physical model. Furthermore, the clean white path created by the eraser is characteristic of digital editing tools, suggesting the image was composited or manipulated using software rather than being captured solely through camera techniques like forced perspective."
0334-7,D
0334-1,"Here are the parts of the video that are not depicting real-life scenes as they appear, using optical illusions or digital manipulation:

1.  **Water bottle pouring into waterfall:** This is an illusion created by holding the bottle close to the camera, making it seem like the water flows directly into the distant waterfall (forced perspective).
2.  **Scissors handles framing bridge:** The scissor handles are held near the camera to perfectly frame the distant bridge, creating an illusion of scale (forced perspective).
3.  **Key held up to archway:** The key is positioned close to the camera so its opening aligns with the large archway in the background (forced perspective).
4.  **Hanger ""holding"" bridge:** A clothes hanger held close to the camera is aligned with a distant bridge to make it look like the hanger is supporting or is part of the bridge structure (forced perspective).
5.  **Highlighters resembling buildings:** Highlighters are held up close to the camera, aligning them with distant buildings so their shapes mimic the architecture (forced perspective).
6.  **Silhouette eating the sun:** The person is positioned so the distant sun appears to be in the bowl they are holding, creating the illusion of eating the sun (forced perspective).
7.  **Pencil erasing roads:** This is a digitally created image showing a giant pencil eraser clearing a path through tangled roads, which is physically impossible.
8.  **Whisk trapping birds:** A whisk held close to the camera against the sky makes distant birds appear as if they are trapped inside its wires (forced perspective)."
0357-1,"The man in the white T-shirt feels amused and surprised when he takes out the item.

*   **Explanation:** Upon pulling the green pickle from the dissolved cotton candy, he immediately bursts into loud, hearty laughter, throws his head back slightly, and points at the pickle, indicating he finds the unexpected and mundane nature of the item comical."
0357-0,"He feels surprised and highly amused.

When the cotton candy dissolves to reveal a pickle, his initial reaction is surprise, immediately followed by loud, hearty laughter, indicating he finds the unexpected and absurd outcome very funny."
0357-2,"No, the man in the white T-shirt did not smile wryly or look disappointed. When he dipped the pink cotton candy into the water and revealed a green pickle, his reaction was one of surprise, followed by a large, genuine laugh, indicating amusement rather than disappointment."
0357-3,"Yes, the man in the white T-shirt appeared happy and amused. When he pulled the pickle from the dissolved cotton candy, he immediately burst into loud laughter and leaned back, clearly entertained by the unexpected and humorous outcome."
0357-7,C
0340-2,"Yes. The video shows the man constructing the dam wall, initially leaving four rectangular outlets. Later, he builds four distinct, sloped drainage channels directly below and aligned with these outlets on the downstream side to manage the water flow."
0340-0,"There are **two** distinct drainage structures shown in the video.

**Explanation:**

1.  The primary drainage structure consists of **four rectangular outlets** built into the main dam wall, each leading to a sloped concrete chute downstream. These are designed for regular, controlled water release.
2.  The second structure is a **separate, curved overflow channel** (spillway) built into the bank on the side of the main dam. This channel is designed to handle excess water during high water levels or floods, preventing the dam from overtopping."
0340-1,"5

Explanation:
There are four sloped concrete channels built directly below the four rectangular water outlets in the main dam wall. Additionally, there is one separate, curved overflow spillway channel constructed to the side. Therefore, the total number of distinct drainage channels shown is 4 + 1 = 5."
0340-7,A
0340-3,"Yes. The video shows the construction of four distinct, sloped drainage channels directly below the four rectangular openings in the main dam wall. Additionally, a separate, curved overflow channel (spillway) is built on the side. This makes a total of five drainage channels."
0368-0,"There are 10 scenarios shown in the video.

Each scenario first depicts the man acting as an adult in a specific situation, followed immediately by him acting as a toddler in the same or a similar situation, highlighting the contrast in behavior."
0368-1,"The man demonstrated 10 different scenarios comparing adult and toddler behavior.

These scenarios included: eating a snack, responding to a request to clean a room, napping, reacting when someone is showering, eating breakfast, watching a show and being interrupted, cleaning up a mess, behavior after a baby falls asleep, giving something to someone, and playing with toys."
0368-3,"No, the man did not show six scenarios. The video actually depicts ten different scenarios comparing adult behavior to exaggerated toddler behavior in various situations like eating, cleaning, napping, and playing."
0368-2,"Yes, the man showed ten scenarios comparing adult and toddler behavior.

The video presents exactly ten distinct pairs of scenes, each contrasting a typical adult action (like eating a snack, napping, or cleaning) with a humorously exaggerated toddler version of the same action. Each comparison is clearly labeled."
0368-7,A
0370-0,"**3**

At the beginning of the video, there are three young women positioned in the front row, each holding a sword in their left hand."
0370-1,"3

At the beginning of the video, the three girls positioned in the front row are each holding a sword."
0370-7,A
0370-3,"Yes. At the very beginning of the video (00:00), only the three performers in the front row are visibly holding swords. The performers behind them are holding flags or other equipment."
0370-2,"No, there are not four girls holding swords at the beginning of the video. There are three girls in the front row holding swords."
0358-7,A
0358-1,"The woman in white was prevented from falling onto the trampoline because she explicitly refused when asked if she would go.

**Explanation:** After pushing the men onto the trampoline, the man turned to the woman and asked, ""What about you?"". The woman clearly indicated her refusal by saying, ""不行不行"" (No, no / I can't, I can't). The man did not push her after her refusal; instead, he decided to perform a stunt himself."
0358-2,"Yes, the woman in white avoided falling onto the trampoline because the man did not push her. After pushing the others, the man asked the woman if she wanted to go, but she declined, and he respected her decision, choosing instead to perform a stunt himself."
0358-0,"The woman in white did not fall onto the trampoline because when the man asked if she would go, she explicitly refused by saying ""不行不行"" (""No, no"" / ""I can't, I can't""). The man respected her refusal and did not push or kick her off the ledge as he had done with the men before her."
0358-3,No. The woman in white declined when asked if she would jump. She remained seated on the platform and was not pushed or kicked onto the trampoline like the men were.
0372-1,"At the conclusion of the video, the girl hangs from the basketball rim.

Explanation: After being lifted onto the boy's shoulders and jumping, she grabs the rim with both hands, suspending her body in the air."
0372-0,"She performs an assisted dunk.

Explanation: The boy lifts the girl up towards the hoop, tosses her the ball (alley-oop), and she catches it mid-air, pushing it down through the rim to score."
0372-2,"No, the girl does not pretend to dunk the basketball. She hangs from the rim as part of the stunt's setup, while the boy picks up the ball and performs the actual dunk underneath her. Her action is solely hanging from the rim while the boy completes the dunk."
0372-3,"No, the girl does not actually dunk the basketball.

**Explanation:** She is lifted onto the boy's shoulders, grabs the rim, and then hangs there. The boy throws the ball up to her, and she guides or pushes the ball through the hoop while hanging. A dunk involves jumping with the ball and forcing it down through the hoop, which she does not do. Her action is assisting the ball into the basket rather than performing a dunk herself."
0372-7,C
0374-3,"Neither. In the first part of the video (0:00-0:04), the person is shown putting the balloon to their mouth and appears to be blowing air into it to inflate it, not inserting or removing an object."
0374-2,"Yes, the magic trick in the first part likely involved using a balloon and an extra, pre-tied knot.

The speed at which the person appears to tie the balloon after bringing it to their mouth is too quick for a standard manual knot. The video later shows a similar action where a pre-tied knot is explicitly used to achieve this rapid ""tying"" effect, strongly implying the first person used the same concealed technique."
0374-1,"The magic trick involves misdirection and a duplicate item.

The first performer pretends to put the knot of the red balloon into his mouth and swallow it, likely hiding it quickly using sleight-of-hand or simply tucking it away inside his mouth.

The video then cuts to the second performer who already has a separate, identical yellow balloon knot piece. He puts this *separate* piece into his mouth. He then brings the actual opening of the yellow balloon (which likely never had a knot or had it removed) to his mouth, creating the illusion that he is producing the knot from his mouth or that it has magically appeared there."
0374-7,D
0374-0,"The performer likely used their mouth to create a vocal sound effect.

**Explanation:** In the first part with the red balloon, the performer touches the side of the balloon, which wouldn't naturally produce the squeaking sound of air escaping. Their mouth movements suggest they are mimicking the sound vocally, creating the illusion that the sound is coming from the balloon interaction. This contrasts with the second part (yellow balloon) where the performer physically manipulates the balloon's opening to create the sound."
0377-0,"The hand on the woman's shoulder belongs to the man sitting next to her on the bench. He has his right arm around her, and his hand is resting on her left shoulder."
0377-3,"Yes, the hand on the woman's shoulder belongs to the man sitting next to her. The video shows him placing his right arm around her left shoulder while they are seated on the bench."
0377-1,The owner of the hand on the woman's shoulder is the man sitting next to her on the right side of the bench. He places his right arm around her shoulder while they are seated.
0377-2,"No.
The hand placed on the woman's right shoulder comes from the man seated next to her on the bench. His arm movement is visible at 0:04, before the other man approaches from behind."

0410-0,"After the sixth (blue) cotton candy dissolved completely in the water, the man who dissolved it looked into the bowl with a confused expression. He then reached into the blue liquid with his hands, searching for an item, but found nothing. He looked up at the others in surprise and bewilderment, showing his empty hands, and the group reacted with confusion and surprise, realizing there was no hidden object inside this time."
0410-2,"Yes, after the sixth cotton candy dissolves, the man finds nothing in the bowl.

He puts the blue cotton candy into the water, it dissolves, and when he reaches into the bowl, he pulls his hands out empty, revealing only the blue liquid."
0410-3,"No, a phone is not revealed in the bowl after the sixth cotton candy dissolves. The final blue cotton candy ball dissolves completely into the water, and the participant reaches in to find the bowl empty, containing only the blue liquid."
0410-1,"The final blue cotton candy ball dissolves completely when placed in the water.

This leaves only blue-colored water in the bowl, with no hidden object being revealed."
0410-7,D
0416-2,"Yes, the spectator was surprised. His surprise stemmed from the egg vanishing from the magician's hand and then discovering it was also not under the cup when he lifted it."
0416-7,E
0416-0,"The magician performing the trick was surprised as part of the performance act. His feigned surprise when the egg wasn't under the cup serves to misdirect the audience, enhance the mystery of the vanishing egg, build dramatic tension, and make the trick more engaging and entertaining through showmanship. It acknowledges the subversion of the expected outcome (the egg appearing under the cup) which he himself set up."
0416-1,"The man performing the trick was taken aback when he personally inspected the cup and found it empty.

His surprise stemmed from the fact that after the spectator initially lifted the cup and found nothing (which might have been part of the plan), the magician himself looked inside the cup (around 0:21-0:24) and reacted with genuine confusion, suggesting the egg's absence at that point was unexpected even to him."
0416-3,No. The spectator was surprised because the egg vanished completely and did not reappear under the cup or anywhere else. His surprise stemmed from the total absence of the egg at the end of the trick.
0417-0,"The meme suggests the soldier on the left is trying hard not to laugh because the flag being raised by the soldier on the right momentarily covers the latter's head. This minor, slightly awkward visual during a formal and serious ceremony is framed as a comical event, creating humor through the imagined internal struggle to maintain composure versus the soldier's actual stoic expression."
0417-3,"No, the person on the left is not trying not to laugh because of an unresolved problem.

His reaction appears to be a direct response to the humorous visual situation where the flag momentarily covers his colleague's head during a formal ceremony. The context and the visual gag itself are the most likely reasons for his suppressed laughter."
0417-2,"No.
Explanation: The person on the left is trying not to laugh because of the humorous mishap where their companion gets tangled in the flag. The seriousness of the occasion is the reason they need to suppress their amusement, not the cause of it."
0417-1,"The soldier on the left is perceived to be trying hard not to laugh because his colleague on the right momentarily gets entangled and covered by the large flag during a very formal and serious ceremony. The humor comes from the unexpected and slightly absurd mishap occurring amidst the strict solemnity and military discipline expected in such a setting. The assumption is that witnessing this awkward moment would naturally provoke amusement, requiring the soldier on the left to actively suppress any reaction to maintain his required composure."
0417-7,C
0420-1,"No, the cat's success cannot be confirmed from the video.

**Explanation:** While the video shows the cat clearly choosing a hand by tapping it, the clip ends immediately after the choice is made. The person does not open their hand to reveal whether the treat was actually inside the chosen fist, so the outcome of the game remains unknown."
0420-0,"No, we cannot determine if the cat won the guessing game. The video ends immediately after the cat taps one of the fists, before the person reveals which hand actually held the object. Without seeing the outcome, it's impossible to know if the cat's choice was correct."
0420-3,"It is impossible to determine if the cat lost the game.

**Explanation:** The video shows the cat choosing the right fist, but it ends before the person reveals whether the object was actually in that hand. Without seeing the outcome, we cannot know if the cat's choice was correct or incorrect, and therefore cannot conclude whether it won or lost."
0420-2,"No, it is impossible to determine if the cat won the game. The video ends immediately after the cat makes its choice, before the person reveals whether the selected fist contained the object."

0427-0,"The man achieved the illusion of instantly cutting the watermelon in half by using a mirror.

He placed the whole watermelon on a stand that had a mirror integrated into its surface. He only cut through the top half of the watermelon. When he lifted the top half, the mirror reflected the red, cut underside of that piece, creating the visual effect that the bottom half remaining on the stand was also perfectly cut."
0427-3,"No, the man did not achieve the trick by hollowing out a watermelon rind and placing a peeled watermelon inside.

The illusion was created using a mirror trick. A prop, likely a picture or cutout of a cut watermelon half, was placed on the mirror's surface. This prop covered the reflection of the actual bottom half of the watermelon, making it appear as though the watermelon was cut when the man lifted the top half. The reflection remained static and showed a cut surface even before the man pretended to cut the watermelon and after he lifted the top half away."
0427-2,"No, the man did not use video editing. The illusion was created using practical effects involving a mirror placed horizontally on the stand to reflect the bottom half of a pre-cut watermelon, while an assistant quickly swapped the whole top half the man was holding with the matching pre-cut top half."
0427-7,A
0427-1,"The man used a mirror and an assistant to create the illusion.

He placed half a watermelon, cut-side down, onto a horizontal mirror. The mirror reflected this half, making it look like a whole watermelon. When he pretended to cut it, he simply lifted his half off the mirror. At the same time, a hidden assistant (Deborah Ann) handed him the other pre-cut half of the watermelon, completing the illusion."
0430-1,"The phone appearing damaged in the video is the result of **staged special effects and the use of pre-damaged props within a performance.**

**Explanation:** The video uses visual tricks, not actual device failure caused by the hand-crank charger. The rapidly increasing battery percentages are impossible and achieved through video editing or a simulated display. The smoke is a practical special effect, and the cracked screens were likely already present on prop phones (as confirmed by the ""FAKE"" sticker shown on the iPhone) which were revealed after the smoke effect to create the illusion of destruction. The hand-crank device itself cannot generate the power needed to cause such effects."
0430-2,"Yes, the phone's damage was staged using props and visual effects. The extremely rapid and unrealistic charging percentages (reaching thousands of percent), the sudden smoke, and the instantaneous shattering are not physically possible with a real phone and charger. Furthermore, the video later reveals a 'FAKE' sticker on the back of the broken phone, confirming it was a prop designed for the effect."
0430-0,"The damage to the phone is a staged special effect.

**Explanation:** The video shows a hand-crank device connected to a phone, causing an impossibly rapid increase in the displayed battery percentage, followed by smoke and screen cracking. A second demonstration with an iPhone reveals a ""FAKE"" sticker inside after similar effects occur, confirming that at least that instance, and likely the first as well, used a prop phone and pre-arranged effects (like smoke generation and a pre-damaged screen) triggered by the device for dramatic effect, rather than genuine damage from electrical overload."
0430-7,C
0430-3,"No, the phone did not get damaged because it was overcharged with the hand-crank charger.

**Explanation:** The video displays impossible battery percentages (like 6000%) and instantaneous, dramatic destruction (shattering, smoke) that are inconsistent with real-world battery failures. Modern phones have built-in safety features to prevent overcharging, and hand-crank chargers produce very low power, making it highly unlikely they could override these protections and cause such damage so quickly. The visual evidence strongly suggests the event was staged using special effects for entertainment, rather than a genuine technical failure."
0432-3,"No, the last targets in the video were not thrown by the person next to the shooter.

The shooter threw the subsequent targets himself after the initial target was thrown by the woman standing next to him."
0432-2,"Yes. While the man initially shoots an orange clay target launched by the woman, the subsequent and final targets shown in the video are the spent shotgun shell casings that he ejects from his firearm, throws into the air himself, and then shoots."
0432-0,"The last few targets come from the man shooting the shotgun.

**Explanation:** After shooting the initial orange clay target thrown by the woman, the man ejects the spent shotgun shell from his firearm, catches or retrieves it, and then throws that empty shell into the air himself to use as the next target. He repeats this process for the subsequent shots shown in the video."
0432-1,"The last few targets in the video are standard clay pigeons (often called clay targets or ""birds"").

**Explanation:** These targets simply shatter into dark fragments when hit by the shotgun pellets. This contrasts with the *first* target shown, which was a special target filled with pink powder that created a visible colored cloud upon impact. The subsequent targets lacked this powder effect and behaved like typical frangible targets used in clay shooting sports."
0432-7,B
0435-0,"The successful swings are:

1.  **First Swing (approx. 0:02):** An upward diagonal cut executed while drawing the sword from a kneeling position, severing the top straw bundle.
2.  **Second Swing (approx. 0:07):** A downward diagonal cut performed after rising slightly, severing the second straw bundle from the top.
3.  **Third Swing (approx. 0:09):** A horizontal cut performed immediately after the second swing, severing the third straw bundle from the top."
0435-1,"The second sword swing, the horizontal cut, successfully hit the straw mat target.

**Explanation:** The first downward diagonal cut only partially cut the top bundle, which remained on the stand. The second horizontal cut cleanly severed the bundle below it, causing that section to fall off the stand, indicating a successful cut."
0435-3,"Yes, the man's sword cut through a section of the straw mat target with every swing. He performed three distinct cuts—a rising diagonal, a falling diagonal, and a horizontal cut—and each swing cleanly severed one specific bundle of straw."
0435-2,"Yes, the man's first sword swing hit the target. The initial upward diagonal katana cut at 0:02 successfully slices through the topmost bundle of straw."

0439-3,"No, the man does not light the object in the video. The object is already actively burning from the very beginning of the clip when the man approaches it with the glass vase."
0439-0,The man does not light anything in the video clip. The candles are already lit when the video begins; he then covers the burning candles with a glass vase.
0439-2,"No, the man does not light the pile of thin candles in the video. The candles are already lit and burning brightly when the video begins."
0439-1,"The man ignites a cluster of blue candles. These candles are grouped together on a base, sitting in a tray of water, and produce a large flame when lit."
0803-2,"Yes, it is true that a bunch of candles is burning in the video. The presenter explicitly refers to the burning objects as ""these candles"" while demonstrating the experiment, and visually, there is a cluster of small, upright elements burning with multiple flames."
0803-3,"No. The burning object appears to be multiple matches embedded upright in a base structure. The flames are coming from the heads of these individual matches, which collectively form the blue/green top section, rather than from a single sponge-like object."
0803-1,"The object on fire is a cluster of candles.

**Explanation:** The object is blue and cylindrical with multiple wicks visible on top, all lit and producing a single large flame. This indicates it's a bundle of individual candles grouped together."
0803-0,"The lit candles were burning in the video.

**Explanation:** Burning, or combustion, requires oxygen. When the vase was placed over the lit candles, it trapped a limited amount of air. The candles consumed the oxygen within the vase as they burned. Once the oxygen level was too low to sustain the flames, the combustion stopped, and the candles went out."

0452-2,"No, there is no indication that the dancer's left leg is disabled. The dancer uses both legs with high skill, strength, and coordination to perform complex breakdancing moves, showing no signs of impairment in either leg."
0452-1,"Both the dancer's left and right legs appear to be in excellent physical condition. They demonstrate significant strength, agility, flexibility, and control, enabling the execution of demanding breakdancing maneuvers, including complex footwork, spins, and weight-bearing transitions, with no visible signs of injury, limitation, or impairment."
0452-3,"No, the dancer does not exhibit a clear separation where the left leg is solely used for agility and the right leg solely for power. The dancer utilizes both legs actively and interchangeably throughout the performance, executing quick steps, spins, pivots, and floor work with coordinated movements involving both the left and right leg for agility, balance, and dynamic shifts."
0452-0,"Based on the video and the meme's premise:

*   **Left Leg (Messi's):** Exhibits characteristics of **agility, control, and finesse**. This is demonstrated through the dancer's intricate, rapid footwork close to the ground, requiring precise balance and coordination, mirroring the technical skill associated with Messi's dribbling.
*   **Right Leg (Ronaldo's):** Displays characteristics of **power, explosiveness, and drive**. This is seen when the dancer uses this leg for strong push-offs, generating momentum for spins and executing dynamic, athletic movements, reflecting the power associated with Ronaldo's style."
0452-7,C
0441-0,"**Left Leg:** Executes a functional running stride, pushing off the ground, swinging back, and then recovering forward with a relatively low knee lift to cover distance. The thigh remains angled downwards throughout the stride, focusing on forward propulsion.

**Right Leg:** Mirrors the left leg's action, performing a functional running stride. It pushes off the ground, swings back, and recovers forward with a similarly low knee lift, contributing to the forward movement across the ground.

**Brief Explanation:** Both legs are engaged in a standard running motion aimed at propelling the body forward. Unlike the exaggerated high-knee, stationary run depicted in the ""expectation"" part, the actual run shows legs working functionally to cover ground, with lower knee lifts and a clear focus on horizontal movement."
0441-3,"No. The video shows the man running with a very low stance, significantly bent knees, and a forward lean. His knees remain relatively close to the ground, lacking the high knee lifts mentioned; the movement resembles a low shuffle or charge rather than a traditional run with high knee elevation."
0441-1,"The man runs with exaggeratedly high knee lifts, driving them towards his chest with each step. His leg movements appear stiff and powerful but lack fluidity, resembling a high-knee drill more than efficient running, contributing to a significant vertical bounce and a relatively short stride length."
0441-2,"The muscular man is staying in roughly the same spot.

The video contrasts a close-up shot, which makes it look like he could be running forward powerfully, with a wider shot (""What they see"") that clearly shows he is performing the running motion while remaining in approximately the same location with minimal forward progress."
0441-7,B
0456-0,The man used 6 railroad spikes in the experiment. He placed 3 spikes into one mug and 3 spikes into the other mug.

0456-1,"The total number of railroad spikes the man used in his experiment was 6.

He placed 3 spikes into one mug (with Monster energy drink) and 3 spikes into the other mug (with white vinegar)."

0463-1,"The counter begins to count from the player's first throw attempt.

**Explanation:** The ""BASKET COUNTER"" graphic appears on screen with five empty circles before the first shot is taken. Immediately after the first throw misses, the first circle updates to show a red 'X', indicating the counter started tracking from that initial attempt."
0463-7,D
0463-3,"No, the counter does not start counting from the throw where the first successful basket is made. The counter registers every throw attempt right from the start, including any missed shots. It visually marks both misses (with a red 'X') and successful baskets (with a green checkmark) sequentially as they happen."
0463-0,"The basket counter starts counting from the **first throw** conducted by the person.

This is shown when the ""BASKET COUNTER"" graphic appears, and immediately after the man takes his initial shot and misses, the first circle on the counter is marked with a red X, indicating the result of that first attempt."
0466-1,"There are **7** images featuring optical illusions in the video.

**Explanation:** These images utilize techniques like forced perspective (making objects appear larger/smaller or interacting with distant objects), opportune timing (capturing moments where elements align coincidentally), and pareidolia (perceiving familiar shapes in random patterns) to create visually deceptive or humorous effects."
0466-3,"No, there are not 5 optical illusion images shown in the video. There are 7 images presented, all of which utilize optical illusions, primarily through forced perspective or opportune timing/alignment."
0466-7,D
0466-2,"Yes, the video contains images related to optical illusions, showcasing examples created through forced perspective, perfect timing, or pareidolia."
0466-0,"There are **7** optical illusion images shown in the video.

**Explanation:**
The video displays seven distinct still images, each using techniques like forced perspective (manipulating the apparent size or position of objects) or precise timing (capturing a specific moment of alignment) to create a visual illusion."
0468-1,"The person in the second clip (starting around 0:10) was able to walk down the stairs successfully. They are seen steadily descending the entire flight of beige carpeted stairs with the visual effect applied, reaching the bottom landing without falling."
0468-2,"Yes, the second person successfully walked down the stairs despite the whirlpool effect. They are seen navigating the steps one by one and descending the staircase without falling or stopping due to the visual distortion."
0468-0,"**Answer:** The second person successfully walked down the stairs.

**Explanation:** The video shows two attempts. The first person (0:00-0:09) stumbles and falls after a few steps. The second person (0:09-0:25) walks down the entire flight of stairs steadily and reaches the bottom landing without falling."
0468-3,"No. The first person did not successfully walk down the stairs; the video shows them losing balance and falling after taking only a few steps, indicated by the abrupt camera movement and accompanying sound."
0468-7,B
0494-3,"No, only one kind of scissors is shown in the video.

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows only one pair of scissors (silver blades, black handles) being used at the beginning to cut the paper spiral. No other types or models of scissors appear in the footage."
0494-2,"No, only one type of scissors is visibly used in the video. These appear to be standard household scissors with black handles, used at the beginning to cut the paper spiral."
0494-1,"**One**
*   **Explanation:** The video shows only a single pair of scissors, identifiable by their black handles and silver blades, being used at the start to cut the paper spiral. No other cutting tools or different types of scissors are visible or used in the remainder of the video."
0494-7,C
0494-0,"One kind of scissors was used in the video.

A single pair of standard household scissors with black handles is shown cutting the paper into a spiral shape at the beginning of the video."
0500-2,"Yes, there are three distinct trick shots featured in the video that use a ping-pong ball. These include hitting a ball between two candles, landing a ball on a dart, and bouncing a ball into a container."
0500-1,"**2**

*   Explanation: There is one white ping-pong ball shown in the candle trick (0:11) and one orange ping-pong ball shown in the dart trick (0:13) and the bottle trick (0:21)."
0500-0,"There are 2 ping-pong balls in the video.

Explanation: One white ping-pong ball is shown being hit between two candles, and one orange ping-pong ball is shown in two separate tricks (bouncing onto a dart and bouncing to knock a tile off a bottle)."
0500-3,"No, there are not four ping-pong balls in the video.

**Explanation:**
The video shows three instances where ping-pong balls are used in trick shots: one white ping-pong ball (around 0:11) and two orange ping-pong balls (around 0:13 and 0:20)."
0500-7,A
0501-1,There are 5 dumplings on the plate. The man in the purple shirt is seen carrying a tray with a plate containing five dumplings at the beginning of the video.
0501-0,"**Answer:** 3

**Explanation:**
The man starts with 5 dumplings on his plate. He eats one himself, leaving 4. Then, a woman feeds him another one, leaving 3 dumplings on the plate."
0501-3,"No, the man in the purple shirt has five dumplings on his plate."
0501-7,C
0501-2,"Yes, the man in the purple shirt has 5 large dumplings on his tray when he sits down at the table."
0520-1,"The letters that require the fewest people to form are I, V, and W.

**Explanation:** These three letters are each formed by a single person in the video, whereas all other letters require two or three people."
0520-0,"The letters that need the minimum number of people (one person) are I, V, and W.

**Explanation:**
*   **I**: A single person stands straight.
*   **V**: A single person sits and raises their legs and torso into a V shape.
*   **W**: A single person lies on their back, arranging their arms and legs to form a W."
0520-3,"**No.** The letter ""I"" requires only one person, but the letters ""V"" and ""W"" are also formed by a single person in the video."
0520-2,"Yes, the letters 'I,' 'V,' and 'W' need only one person each to form in the video.

**Explanation:**
*   **I (0:18):** A single woman stands straight to form the letter 'I'.
*   **V (0:47):** A single woman sits and raises her legs in a V-shape to form the letter 'V'.
*   **W (0:49):** A single woman lies on her back, spreading her legs and bending her arms to form the letter 'W'."
0520-7,E
0512-1,The ping-pong ball bounced off 5 pots at the start of the video. It bounces off the bottom of four upside-down pots and then off the side of one right-side-up pot before falling into a red cup.
0512-3,"No, the ping-pong ball did not hit only two pots at the beginning of the video. It interacted with four pot lids.

1.  The ball rolls off the initial track and lands on the lid of the first pot.
2.  It bounces off that lid onto the lid of the second pot.
3.  It bounces off the second lid onto the lid of the third pot.
4.  Finally, it bounces off the third lid onto the lid of the fourth pot before continuing its journey.

Therefore, the ball made contact with four distinct pot lids."
0512-2,"No, the ping-pong ball did not hit seven pots at the beginning of the video. It bounced off three pots sequentially right after falling from the initial ramp."
0512-7,C
0512-0,"The ping-pong ball hit **4** pots at the beginning of the video.

**Explanation:** The ball first drops from the track and hits the underside of an inverted pot on a stand, then bounces sequentially off the bottoms of three more pots arranged below it before continuing its path."
0522-3,"No. The video does not show three men wearing hats at the same time. While one man wears a pink novelty helmet/hat in several scenes and another man is briefly shown wearing a grey baseball cap, there is never an instance where three men are simultaneously wearing headgear. The maximum number of men wearing a hat/helmet in any single shot is one."
0522-1,"**Answer:** 2

**Explanation:**
Two distinct men are shown wearing hats in the video:
1.  One man wears a pink novelty helmet/hat shaped like a unicorn or rhino head. He appears multiple times dancing with different groups.
2.  Another man is shown briefly lying in the sand wearing a grey baseball cap backwards."
0522-2,"Yes, two distinct men wear hats in the video. One man wears a pink novelty hat resembling a unicorn or rhino, and another man briefly appears wearing a grey baseball cap backwards."
0522-7,D
0522-0,"**2**

Explanation: One man is seen wearing a grey baseball cap, and a different man is seen wearing a pink novelty helmet (shaped like a unicorn or rhino)."
0525-0,"**Answer:** Two legs.

**Explanation:** The video shows a helper wading through the floodwater towards the person in the wheelchair. This helper is clearly a person moving on their two legs."
0525-7,B
0525-3,"Yes, it is true that the person not in the wheelchair has two legs. The video shows this individual running into the floodwater and wading through it to reach and assist the person in the wheelchair, actions that clearly demonstrate the use of both legs for movement."
0525-2,"No, the person not in the wheelchair does not have only one leg. The video clearly shows them running into the floodwater and wading using both legs to reach and assist the person in the wheelchair."
0525-1,"Two legs.

**Explanation:** The video shows the person running through the water to assist the individual in the wheelchair, clearly using two legs for locomotion, which is typical for a human."
0526-0,"In the second video segment (starting around 00:10), the man is holding **two** lighters.

He holds a standard orange disposable lighter in one hand and a blue/purple pen-shaped torch lighter in the other hand. He uses the flame from the standard lighter to ignite the torch lighter."
0526-1,"**Two.**

The man is holding one standard orange lighter in his left hand and one blue pen-style lighter in his right hand simultaneously, using the flame from the first to light the second."
0526-2,"No, the man is not holding two lighters in his hands in the second video. He is holding one lit orange lighter in his left hand and a blue/purple pen or stylus in his right hand."
0526-3,"No, the man is not holding three lighters. He is holding two lighters: an orange disposable lighter in his left hand and a blue torch lighter in his right hand."
0526-7,B
0530-1,The man in blue chose to kick the soccer ball placed on the ground further away from the kneeling man (the ball on the left from the kicker's perspective).
0530-0,"The man in blue kicked the soccer ball placed slightly forward on the grass, just ahead of the ball being held in the kneeling man's right hand (the ball on the viewer's left)."
0530-3,"**No.**

The fifth scene in the video (0:07-0:09) features a skateboarder performing a trick. The scene with the man in blue kicking a soccer ball occurs later, in the seventh scene (0:10-0:11). Furthermore, in that scene, he kicks the bottom ball, not the top one being held."
0530-2,"No, the man in blue did not kick the middle ball *resting on the grass*. He kicked the soccer ball that was being held steady for him by the kneeling man, which happened to be positioned above and between the two balls on the grass."
0530-7,A
0539-0,"Based on the video, **5** individuals who are not inside a vehicle appear to be frightened by the masked person's actions.

**Explanation:**
The video shows two instances where people outside of vehicles react with fear:
1.  A group of **four** young people walking on a sidewalk scream and run away when they see the mask (0:06-0:10).
2.  A female postal worker standing outside her mail truck looks startled and frightened, stepping back into her vehicle upon seeing the mask (0:58-1:00).

Therefore, the total count is 4 + 1 = 5."
0539-2,"No.
Explanation: The video shows five people outside of vehicles reacting with fear: four pedestrians (seen between 0:06-0:10) and one mail carrier (seen between 0:58-1:00). There are not six people shown scared outside of a car."
0539-1,"**5** individuals outside of cars react with fear.

**Explanation:**

*   At 0:06, a group of four individuals walking on the sidewalk react by screaming and running away upon seeing the masked person.
*   At 0:58, a female mail carrier standing next to her truck screams and runs away after noticing the masked person."
0539-3,"No, the statement is not true. The video shows a group of four pedestrians on the sidewalk reacting fearfully, and later, a mail carrier standing outside her truck also reacts with fear. This makes a total of five people not in a car who were scared."
0539-7,C
0541-0,There are 8 teeth shown in the drawing in the video. This includes 4 teeth drawn on the upper row and 4 teeth drawn on the lower row.
0541-1,"**12:** There are 6 teeth drawn in the upper row and 6 teeth drawn in the lower row, totaling 12 teeth shown in the illustration throughout the video."
0541-2,No. The video consistently displays a drawing with only 8 teeth (4 upper and 4 lower) from start to finish.
0541-3,"No.

**Explanation:** The outlines representing the teeth are drawn on the paper inside the bag and remain visible throughout the process as the bag is dipped in water. The water causes the black spots drawn on the *outside* of the bag to seemingly disappear due to the interaction with water (likely refraction or displacement), changing the appearance of the teeth from ""dirty"" to ""clean,"" but the number of visible teeth outlines does not change or decrease to none."
0541-7,D
0542-0,"The scene shown as a metaphor for the passage of time occurs at 0:49. In this scene, the cook sits calmly underneath the small waterfall, letting the water flow over them.

**Explanation:** The continuous, steady flow of the waterfall visually represents the constant, unstoppable passage of time. The cook's passive waiting posture under the flow mirrors the necessary waiting period while the bread bakes using the heat from the coals."
0542-1,"**0:49 - Person relaxing by the waterfall:** This brief scene cuts away from the campfire after the coals have been placed on the cooking pan's lid. It shows the cook waiting passively, symbolizing the time required for the stromboli to bake using the heat from the fire below and the coals above."
0542-2,"Yes, the scene likely serves as a visual representation of time passing while the stromboli bakes. It depicts a moment of calm waiting and patience required during the cooking process over the fire, bridging the gap between placing the food to cook and revealing the finished product."
0542-3,"Yes, the scene where the person is bathing under the waterfall is used to signify the passage of time while the stromboli is cooking.

**Explanation:** The video shows the stromboli being placed in the pan and covered with coals to bake (0:47-0:48). It then immediately cuts to the waterfall scene (0:49) before cutting back to show the coals being removed and the cooked stromboli revealed (0:50-0:51). This placement strongly indicates that the waterfall scene acts as a visual cutaway, representing the interval during which the baking process occurred off-screen. It's a common editing technique to condense time and maintain visual interest."
0542-7,D
0548-0,The second thing the man clips with the car window is a cucumber. He holds it up to the closing window immediately after clipping a hot dog.
0548-1,"The second item the man holds against the car window is a cucumber. In the video sequence, he first holds up a hot dog, then replaces it with a cucumber, and finally holds up a carrot."
0548-7,B
0548-2,"Yes. The video shows the man in the car holding up a sausage to the window, and immediately afterward, at approximately the 0:09 mark, he holds up a cucumber in the same manner."
0548-3,"No, the carrot is the third item the man holds up with the car window, not the second.
Explanation: The man first holds up a hot dog (0:07), then a cucumber (0:08), and finally the carrot (0:09)."
0551-3,"No, the question cannot be answered as posed because only one white rocker switch is visible on the wall in the scene with the woman kneeling."
0551-1,"The switch plate is mounted vertically on the white wall section located between the glass-panelled door (on the left) and the tall brown cabinet (on the right). It is positioned significantly above the door handle, appearing at a standard height for light switches within that wall space, well above the kneeling woman's head level."
0551-2,"No, the light switch remains in the same down position throughout the scene where the woman is kneeling."
0551-0,The switch on the wall is in the down position. This usually indicates that the switch is in the 'off' state.
0551-7,B
0755-3,"No, the sponge is not made of synthetic materials like polyurethane foam. The video shows the woman biting the sponge, and the overall theme reveals that everyday objects presented are actually hyperrealistic edible desserts or cakes."
0755-1,"The object shown in the video, resembling a kitchen sponge, is actually a hyperrealistic cake.

Its composition likely consists of:
1.  A yellow-colored cake base (such as sponge cake or vanilla cake colored with yellow food coloring) forming the main body, mimicking the soft part of the sponge.
2.  A green top layer, replicating the scouring pad, made from a textured edible material like colored fondant, modeling chocolate, green-colored Rice Krispie treats, or crushed cookies, adhered to the cake base."
0755-2,"Yes, the sponge in the video is made of an edible material like cake. This is shown when the woman bites into and chews the sponge at the beginning of the video, indicating it is food rather than a real cleaning sponge. The video continues to show other seemingly inedible items that are revealed to be cake, establishing a theme of edible illusions."
0755-0,"The material of the object resembling a sponge is **cake**.

**Explanation:** The video shows the woman biting into and eating the ""sponge"" after pretending to clean with it. Subsequent scenes reveal other objects, like noodles and a cleaning bucket, are also hyperrealistic cakes, establishing a pattern that the ""sponge"" is edible and made of cake."
0755-7,B
0552-2,"Yes, the person in the kitchen is carrying three toasted sandwiches on the plate, and each sandwich is made using a pair of sliced bread."
0552-0,"**Answer:** 4 slices of bread.

**Explanation:** The plate holds four triangular halves of grilled sandwiches. Since two halves make one complete sandwich, there are two complete sandwiches on the plate. A standard sandwich is made using two slices of bread, so two complete sandwiches contain a total of four slices of bread (2 sandwiches x 2 slices/sandwich = 4 slices)."
0552-3,"Yes, the items on the plate are made using four slices of bread. However, they are presented as four halves of two complete toasted sandwiches, which is a more accurate description of the prepared food shown."
0552-1,There are 3 toasted sandwich halves on the plate held by the person in the kitchen.
0552-7,D
0561-0,"8

The watch appears on the man's wrist in each of the eight time-lapse segments shown (2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year, and 2 years)."
0561-2,"No, the man's watch does not appear 7 times. It appears 8 times, once in each segment shown (2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year, and 2 years)."
0561-7,C
0561-3,"No, the man's watch does not appear 10 times. It appears 8 times, once in each of the 8 distinct scenes shown in the video, corresponding to the different time points presented (from 2 months to 2 years)."
0561-1,"The man's watch appears in every segment throughout the video. It is consistently visible on his left wrist in all the photos shown, from the 2-month mark to the 2-year mark."
0567-1,"The hair color of the third individual shown in the video is black. This woman, seen preparing food and distributing it, has long, straight, dark hair that appears black."
0567-0,"The third person in the video has black hair. She is seen preparing healthy snacks, and her hair is long and dark, appearing black."
0567-2,"Yes, the third person shown prominently in the video is a woman with long, straight black hair. She is featured preparing homemade, healthy cereal and yogurt from scratch using fruits like mango, kiwi, beetroot, and strawberries, and later distributing the finished food cups to people in need."
0567-3,"No, the third person in the video is the woman with long dark hair who is shown making healthy snacks and distributing them. The person with blonde hair and dark roots is the first person shown in the video, pouring the cereal."
0567-7,A
0566-0,"Based on the visual narrative and the concluding text, the scene with the broken pot of plant is included as a visual metaphor.

**Explanation:** The act of sweeping up the spilled dirt and pebbles from the broken plant represents a basic cleanup attempt, analogous to using only dry toilet paper. While sweeping removes the larger mess, it often leaves behind finer particles or residue. This scene, alongside others depicting various messes, serves to illustrate situations where a simple cleanup might be insufficient, thereby highlighting the benefit of using Neve toilet paper *and* wipes for a more complete and thorough clean, a benefit the ad suggests is ""obvious"" once understood."
0566-1,"The purpose of showing the broken pot of plant and the subsequent sweeping is to create a visual metaphor. The spilled soil represents the initial mess or residue left after using the toilet. Sweeping it up with a brush and dustpan is analogous to the first step of cleaning, similar to using dry toilet paper, which might remove the bulk but not necessarily achieve a complete clean, thereby setting the stage for the improved clean offered by the wipes shown later."
0566-2,"Yes, the scenes with the broken pot of plant symbolize the mess and the ineffective cleaning process of using rolled toilet paper.

**Explanation:** The messy attempt to sweep up the spilled soil and pebbles with a dry brush acts as a visual metaphor. It parallels the idea that using only dry toilet paper can be an inefficient method for personal cleaning, potentially spreading residue or leaving particles behind rather than achieving a complete and thorough clean, much like the brush struggles to cleanly gather all the spilled dirt."
0566-3,"No, the scenes with the broken pot of plant do not highlight the effectiveness of Neve toilet paper or wipes.

**Explanation:** In the scene where the dirt and succulent from the broken pot are cleaned up (0:20–0:24, 0:28–0:31), a brush and dustpan are used, not Neve products. The effectiveness of Neve wipes is demonstrated in a separate scene where reddish powder is wiped clean from a surface (0:31–0:35, 0:48–0:50)."
0566-7,B
0571-0,"The man wears the ring on his right hand's ring finger.

**Explanation:** A silver-colored ring is clearly visible on the fourth finger (ring finger) of the man's right hand throughout the video as he handles the objects."
0571-3,"Yes, the man is wearing a metallic ring on the ring finger of his right hand. The video clearly shows the ring in several shots when his right hand is in view."
0571-2,"No, the man's ring is not worn on the middle finger of his left hand. The video clearly shows the ring is worn on the ring finger of his right hand, and his left hand has no rings at all."
0571-1,"**Answer:** Ring finger

**Explanation:**
The man is wearing a metallic ring on the fourth finger of his right hand. This is clearly visible throughout the video, for example, when he is holding the first illusion (0:01), examining the Penrose triangle (0:05, 0:11), and holding the final illusion (0:34 onwards). This fourth finger is commonly referred to as the ring finger."
0571-7,A
0575-2,"Yes. The video shows the little girl wearing pink flip-flops. When the woman asks for her phone, the man lifts the girl's right flip-flop and retrieves a phone with a pink case from underneath it."
0575-3,None
0575-1,None
0575-0,The little girl is wearing a pair of pink flip-flops on her feet. These are open-toed sandals with a Y-shaped strap that goes between the big toe and the second toe.
0575-7,D
0576-0,"The girl styled as GEN-Z uses a belt. In the video, she adds a black belt over her grey sweater as part of the outfit assembly."
0576-3,"No, the millennial girl is not the one using a belt. The video shows the figure labeled ""GEN-Z"" adding and wearing a belt over her sweater as part of her outfit."
0576-2,"Yes, the GEN-Z girl is the one using a belt in the video. The video shows her adding a black belt over the grey sweater before putting on the blazer as part of the GEN-Z outfit styling."
0576-1,"**GEN-Z:** The video shows the woman labeled ""GEN-Z"" putting on a grey crewneck sweater and then adding a black belt over it at the waist (around 0:06-0:07)."
0576-7,D
0578-1,"**7**

*   **Explanation:** There are seven distinct individuals shown:
    1.  Johnny English (Rowan Atkinson in the dark suit).
    2.  The parkour antagonist (in the grey suit).
    3.  A construction worker on the first rooftop (white hard hat).
    4.  A second construction worker on the first rooftop (yellow vest).
    5.  The construction worker operating the crane platform (hard hat, yellow vest).
    6.  A background pedestrian in a pink/red jacket (final scene).
    7.  Another background pedestrian next to the one in pink/red (final scene)."
0578-3,"Yes, there could be at least ten people in the video.

**Explanation:**

Throughout the video clips, we see several distinct individuals:
1.  The man performing parkour over the scaffolding.
2.  The character Johnny English observing and then taking a different route.
3.  Another man jumping between rooftops.
4.  At least two construction workers on the rooftop where the jump occurs.
5.  A construction worker operating the lift Johnny English uses.
6.  A man climbing down scaffolding and running through an alley.
7.  At least three other pedestrians are visible in the alleyway scene near the end.

Counting these individuals confirms there are at least 10 people shown."
0578-2,"Yes, there are at least eight people visible in the video.

**Explanation:** The video shows two main characters (the parkour runner and Mr. Bean), at least three distinct construction workers across the rooftop and lift scenes, and at least three different pedestrians in the final alley scene. This totals a minimum of eight individuals."
0578-0,"The number of people visible varies throughout the video, ranging from 1 person in some scenes to approximately 6 people in others. Different scenes show individuals alone, pairs, or small groups including construction workers and bystanders during chase sequences."
0578-7,B
0588-0,"There are 5 drawers on the white dresser with the globe.

Explanation: Visual inspection shows 2 smaller drawers on the top row and 3 larger drawers stacked below them."
0588-2,"Yes, the white desk with the globe on top has five drawers.

There are two smaller drawers side-by-side on the top, and three larger drawers stacked below them."
0588-1,"**Answer:** 5
**Explanation:** The white furniture piece with the globe on top has two smaller drawers arranged horizontally on the top row and three larger drawers stacked vertically below them, totaling five drawers."
0588-7,A
0588-3,"No, that statement is not true. The white dresser shown in the video with the globe on top has five drawers: two smaller drawers on the top row and three larger drawers underneath."
0580-3,No. The girl took three steps on the warped wall before leaping to grab the top edge.
0580-2,"No, she took fewer steps. The video shows her taking three steps on the wall (right foot, left foot, right foot) before jumping to grab the top ledge."
0580-1,"**Answer:** 3 steps.
**Explanation:** The woman plants her right foot, then her left foot, then her right foot again on the curved surface of the wall before launching herself upwards to grab the top edge."
0580-0,"**6**

**Brief Explanation:**
The girl takes three steps on the flat ground as she approaches the wall. She then takes three additional steps up the curved face of the wall before launching herself upwards to grab the top edge. (3 ground steps + 3 wall steps = 6 total steps)."
0580-7,B
0589-0,"No.

**Explanation:**

While the video uses time markers showing the chocolate level decreasing over a supposed six-hour period, text displayed later in the video explicitly states, ""I ate this in small batches over several days."" This indicates the chocolate was consumed over a longer period, not within the six hours depicted."
0589-2,"No. At the six-hour mark in the video, the level of chocolate remaining in the tank is visibly well below the halfway point compared to the initial amount, indicating more than half had already been consumed."
0589-3,"No, the video did not show that it took 12 hours for the person to finish the chocolate. The 12-hour timeframe shown in the video corresponds to the completion of the separate challenge involving drinking coconut water with a fork, not the chocolate eating challenge, which was only shown partially completed up to the 6-hour mark."
0589-1,"No, the individual did not consume all the chocolate within a six-hour period. The video explicitly states that the chocolate was eaten in small batches over several days."
0589-7,A
0590-1,"The man in the black jacket screamed because the man in the red sweater placed a large, fake tarantula directly onto his face while he was lying on the floor. This sudden action caused a reaction of shock and fear."
0590-7,B
0590-0,"The man in the black jacket screamed because the man in the red sweater placed a large, fake spider directly onto his face while he was lying on the floor at the bottom of the stairs.

*Explanation:* After the man in the black jacket slipped and fell at the bottom of the stairs, the man in the red sweater picked up a large toy spider that was on the steps and deliberately put it on the fallen man's forehead, causing him to scream in shock or fear."
0590-2,"Yes, the man in the black jacket screamed because the other man put a toy spider directly on his face. The video shows the man in red placing the toy tarantula on the intruder's face while he is lying on the ground, and the intruder screams immediately in reaction."
0590-3,"No, the man in the black jacket did not scream because he stepped on a spider. He screamed because a fake spider was thrown by the other man and landed on his face, startling him as he lay at the bottom of the stairs."
0595-1,"The boy, Michiel, used a large blue exercise ball, a soccer ball, and a tennis ball to score. He successfully threw or headed each of these three types of balls into the goal next to the pool."
0595-3,"No, the boy did not score with a basketball, a volleyball, and a baseball.

**Explanation:**

The video shows the boy (Michiel) successfully getting three different balls into the swimming pool: a large blue exercise ball, a soccer ball, and a tennis ball. He did not use or score with a basketball, a volleyball, or a baseball."
0595-2,"Yes, the boy (Michiel) did score with all three balls. The video shows him successfully throwing the blue exercise ball, heading the soccer ball, and throwing the tennis ball over the net into the swimming pool, earning a green checkmark for each attempt on the scoreboard."
0595-0,"The boy, Michiel, scored with the large blue exercise ball, the soccer ball, and the tennis ball. The video shows him successfully getting each of these items into the goal next to the pool, marked by green checkmarks appearing under his name for each successful attempt."
0595-7,D
0597-3,"It cannot be determined from the video what the person holding the camera is wearing. The camera operator is never visible in the footage, so there is no visual information to confirm their clothing."
0597-0,"The person holding the camera is an active participant and actor in the video skits, filming from a first-person perspective while consistently running forward. They interact directly with the second actor in each scenario, often carrying or manipulating props relevant to the skit (like a burning box, mailbox, wheelchair, luggage, or shopping basket). This role requires significant coordination as they must simultaneously run, operate the camera, handle props, and react to the other actor's performance, making them central to both the filming and the comedic action."
0597-2,"**Answer:** No.

**Explanation:** While the camera operator's white sneakers can occasionally be seen at the bottom edge of the video frame during movement, their upper body is never visible. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the video whether they are wearing a light gray jacket."
0597-1,"The person operating the camera is never visible within the frame.

Because they remain off-screen throughout the video, their physical appearance, clothing, and specific identity cannot be determined. However, the dynamic nature of the filming, which follows running subjects smoothly, indicates the operator is also moving, likely running, while skillfully handling the camera to provide the viewer's perspective."
0597-7,B
0600-0,"Based on the video, the orange ball did not hit the boy. He successfully jumped over it as it rolled underneath him."
0600-1,"The orange ball did not make contact with the boy in the video. Throughout the boy's turn performing tricks, the large orange ball remains stationary in the background on the grass and is not touched or interacted with by him."
0600-3,"No, the orange ball did not hit the boy on his back. The video shows the large orange ball remaining stationary on the grass, well away from the boy while he performs his footwork drills. There was no contact between the boy and the orange ball."
0600-2,"No, the orange ball did not hit the boy on his head. The large orange exercise ball remained stationary on the grass throughout the video and never made contact with the boy."
0600-7,E
0609-1,"Elimination is decided based on reaction time. Participants place their hands on a table around a spinning object. When the object stops spinning, the last person to lift their hand off the table is eliminated."
0609-0,"The ball leaving the table determines elimination. A player is eliminated from the game when the ball rolls off the edge of the table near their position, indicating they failed to keep it in play."
0609-2,Yes. Players are eliminated if they lift their hands from the table before the spinning ball comes to a complete stop.
0609-3,"No, elimination is not determined by who is holding the ball when it stops. Instead, the player closest to the ball when it stops moving appears to be eliminated."
0609-7,B
0607-1,"**Answer:** The man is hanging upside down from the ceiling.

**Explanation:** His feet are attached to the ceiling using specialized gear (appearing like large suction cups), and his body is suspended vertically downwards with his head pointing towards the floor."
0607-3,"No, the man in the video is not standing on the ceiling. He is hanging upside down from the ceiling, supported by devices attached to his feet that appear to use suction to adhere to the ceiling surface."
0607-2,"No, the man is not standing on the ground made to look like a ceiling.

**Explanation:**
He is actually hanging upside down from the real ceiling. Evidence for this includes the balloons floating upwards towards the surface he is attached to, the basketball falling downwards towards the floor when dropped, and the furniture being oriented normally on the floor below him. These details confirm standard gravity and room orientation."
0607-7,A
0607-0,"At the end of the video, the man begins to fall and swing downwards.

**Explanation:** The suction device attached to his left foot detaches from the ceiling, causing his left side to drop. He pivots around his right foot, which remains attached, and starts swinging downwards while exclaiming in surprise."
0620-3,"No, the man is not standing on the ceiling. He is hanging upside down from the ceiling using gear-shaped devices attached to his feet that appear to function via suction."
0620-0,"The man in the video is not standing. He is hanging upside down from the ceiling, with his feet attached to devices fixed to the ceiling, positioning him above the floor in the middle of a room."
0620-1,"The man is hanging upside down from the ceiling.

His feet are attached to the ceiling using specialized gear, suspending his body in an inverted position with his head pointing towards the floor."
0620-7,B
0620-2,"No, the man is not standing on the ground. He is genuinely hanging upside down from the actual ceiling, attached via black gear-shaped supports fixed to the ceiling. This is confirmed by the normal orientation of the room's furniture and the way gravity affects other objects, such as the balloons floating upwards towards the ceiling and the basketball falling downwards towards the floor when released."
0603-7,C
0603-3,"**No.**

While the person wearing the red shirt with a white 'M' logo and standing in the pink hula hoop does lose hearts (decreasing from three to one), this loss is not because he failed twice in a row. He fails his first stunt (0:02) and his third stunt (0:18), but successfully completes a stunt in between (0:10). Furthermore, heart loss in the video occurs when the opponent successfully completes a stunt and pops the player's balloon (seen at 0:05 and 0:22 for the red player), not as a direct result of the player failing their own stunt."
0603-2,"Yes. The player wearing the blue t-shirt and dark blue pants failed his last two attempts consecutively (at 0:30-0:32 and 0:39-0:42). These failures resulted in the opposing player popping his last two heart icons (at 0:33-0:34 and 0:43-0:44), ultimately causing the water balloon above him to burst."
0603-0,"The person who failed twice in a row and lost the heart-shaped pattern is the competitor wearing the blue t-shirt and blue athletic pants.

*   **Explanation:** This individual failed two consecutive stunt attempts by landing outside of his blue hoop (around 0:31 and 0:41 in the video). Each failure resulted in the loss of one of his blue heart icons displayed at the top of the screen. Losing the second of these consecutive attempts depleted his final heart, leading to his water balloon being popped as a consequence. He was barefoot during the challenge."
0603-1,"The person who failed twice in a row (at 0:32 and 0:41) and lost a heart-shaped pattern each time has the following features:

*   Wears a blue T-shirt.
*   Wears blue athletic pants with white stripes.
*   Has dark hair and a beard/mustache.
*   Is barefoot.
*   Stands inside a blue hula hoop.

This player is associated with the blue balloons and the blue pixelated hearts, losing one heart after each failed attempt during that sequence."
0610-0,"The woman threw the package out the window to demonstrate extreme efficiency and speed, fitting the video's theme of rapid task completion. It serves as the quickest way to transfer the package to the waiting men outside and acts as a non-verbal signal for them to immediately proceed with their next task, highlighting their seamless coordination and readiness."
0610-1,"The woman tossed the package out of the window to signal her hyper-efficient helpers to instantly take it for mailing.

**Explanation:** Throughout the video, the two men provide immediate and exaggeratedly efficient service for the woman's domestic needs (setting the table, making the bed, unloading the car). Tossing the package out the window is her effortless method of dispatching it, acting as a cue for the men waiting outside to retrieve it and fulfill their role as her personal, instantaneous postal carriers. This action fits the video's comedic theme of extreme convenience and surreal domestic service."
0610-3,"No, the woman was not trying to get rid of the package by throwing it out the window. The men immediately running to catch it indicates it was a planned and coordinated rapid transfer or handover to them, not an act of disposal."
0610-7,C
0610-2,"No.

The men immediately run away from the house towards the street after catching the package, rather than towards a mailbox. Their action suggests they were taking the package *away* as another rapidly completed task, consistent with the other stylized, high-speed actions shown in the video, not specifically helping her mail it via a local mailbox."
0612-1,"The paper is divided into two sections to create a direct, side-by-side comparison.

The left side, labeled ""$0 Pencils,"" demonstrates creating the artwork using unconventional, free materials (like burnt matches, coffee, grass, food items) instead of actual pencils. The right side, labeled ""$300 Pencils,"" shows the same artwork being created using expensive, traditional colored pencils. This split visually contrasts the processes, techniques, and results achievable with high-cost professional supplies versus readily available, zero-cost alternatives, highlighting resourcefulness and the relationship between tools and artistic outcome."
0612-0,"The paper is divided into two parts to directly compare the results of creating the same artwork using two vastly different sets of materials:

*   **Left Side ($0 Pencils):** This side demonstrates resourcefulness, using free, unconventional items found around the house or outdoors (like burnt matches, coffee, grass, berries, candy, toothpaste) as pigments.
*   **Right Side ($300 Pencils):** This side uses expensive, professional-grade colored pencils.

The split allows for a clear, side-by-side visual comparison, highlighting the differences in texture, vibrancy, technique, and overall outcome between using no-cost, DIY materials versus high-cost, traditional art supplies. It serves to illustrate both the artist's ingenuity with basic materials and the qualities offered by professional tools."
0612-2,"Yes, the purpose of dividing the paper is to directly compare the artistic results achieved using non-traditional, essentially free materials (labeled ""$0 Pencils"") on one side, with those achieved using standard, expensive colored pencils (labeled ""$300 Pencils"") on the other side. The split-screen format and clear labels explicitly set up this contrast, allowing viewers to evaluate the effectiveness, appearance, and potential of vastly different art supplies when rendering the same image."
0612-3,"Yes, the paper is divided to directly compare the results achieved using conventional, expensive colored pencils (labeled ""$300 Pencils"") on one side versus readily available, free, unconventional materials (like burnt matches, coffee, grass, food items, toothpaste, labeled ""$0 Pencils"") used as drawing mediums on the other side for the same portrait subject."
0612-7,D
0616-1,"**Winner:** White ball.
**Reason:** Although it started last, the white ball navigated the obstacles more efficiently and reached the final channel at the end of the track before the blue and black balls."
0616-0,"The white (cream) ball reaches the finish line first. Although it was released last, it navigated the obstacles more efficiently and overtook the other balls to enter the final channel ahead of them."
0616-2,"**Yes**, the white ball is the first to reach the finish line.

Although it starts behind the blue and black balls, it navigates the obstacles more effectively and enters the final narrow channel ahead of the other two, securing the lead and finishing first."
0616-3,"No, the blue ball does not reach the finish line first. The white/yellowish ball overtakes the blue ball during the course and enters the final channel ahead of it."
0616-7,A
0614-3,"No, the man's hands do not appear to be trembling in the video. His actions, such as eating, pouring a drink, handling a gift, and gesturing, are performed smoothly and deliberately, indicating composure rather than physical signs of nervousness or excitement."
0614-1,"Based on the video, the man's hands do not appear to tremble while he is eating at the start. His movements when handling the fork, pouring the juice, and bringing food or drink to his mouth are steady and controlled."
0614-2,"No, the man is not pretending to have a disability causing his hands to tremble. His movements, including pouring the drink first into the glass and then onto the salad, appear steady and deliberate. The subsequent interaction with the waitress, involving pointing, gifting, and a high-five, suggests the entire scenario was likely staged or playful rather than an attempt to feign a disability."
0614-0,"The man in the video does not appear to be trembling. His hands are steady as he eats and pours his drink because he seems calm and focused on his meal. Eating is a routine activity, and he shows no signs of stress or nervousness related to the simple task or the restaurant environment."
0614-7,C
0625-1,"The second ball moves to the **right**.

It appears at the center where the vertical and horizontal tracks intersect and then travels along the horizontal track to the right."
0625-3,"No, the second ball does not follow a circular path or move in a loop. It travels back and forth along a straight, indented horizontal track, reversing its direction at each end of the track."
0625-0,The second sphere moves horizontally to the right. This movement follows the horizontal track that appears on the surface.
0625-2,"No, the second ball does not move back and forth along the horizontal groove. It appears at the center, moves outward to the right along the groove, and then stops near the purple edge."
0625-7,A
0621-1,The video does not show any person placing a foot against the wall first. The participants begin standing with their backs already close to the wall and then lean their upper bodies backward against it before pushing off.
0621-2,"No, the left foot is not the first one to lean against the wall. In the video, all participants keep their left feet planted on the grass and do not lean them against the wall at any point during the challenge."
0621-0,"Based on the video, no person's foot leans against the wall. The individuals who brace against the wall (Michiel and Mini Michiel) do so with their upper backs and shoulders, keeping their feet on the ground."
0621-7,B
0621-3,"No, the right foot is not the first one to lean against the wall in the video.

**Explanation:**

The participants lean their upper bodies (backs and shoulders) towards the wall. Mini Michiel and Michiel make contact with the wall using their backs first, while their feet remain on the ground away from the wall. The other participants fall forward without touching the wall. No foot makes the initial contact with the wall."
0633-3,"No, the wheels of the black car are not turning in reverse at the end of the video. The wheels are rotating forward, consistent with the car's attempt to move forward on the snowy surface."
0633-2,"Yes, the wheels of the black car are rotating forward at the end of the video, propelling the vehicle through the snow."
0633-0,"The wheels of the black car turn **clockwise** (when viewed from the outside, as shown in the video). This rotation is necessary to propel the car forward, as seen by the car moving from right to left across the screen."
0633-7,B
0633-1,"**Clockwise:** The black car is shown moving forward at the end of the video. For a car to move forward, the wheels on the driver's side (as viewed in the video) must rotate in a clockwise direction."
0627-1,"**The Camera:** The camera changed its position by panning from side to side. This movement alters the viewing angle and perspective, creating the optical illusion that the stationary cutout's head is turning to follow the viewer."
0627-3,"No, the woman in the video is not moving the cutout to make its head appear to turn. The perceived movement is an optical illusion, specifically the hollow-face illusion. This effect occurs because the cutout's face is concave (hollowed inwards), but our brain interprets it as a convex (normal) face that turns to follow the camera as the viewing angle changes."
0627-2,"Yes, the photographer is moving the camera from side to side. This movement demonstrates an optical illusion where the dragon cutout appears to turn its head and follow the camera, altering the perceived position of the woman relative to the dragon's head, even though the woman herself remains relatively stationary."
0627-7,A
0627-0,"Both the camera and the woman are changing their position. The camera moves significantly from side to side, causing the background to shift and creating the optical illusion effect with the cutout. The woman also shifts her position slightly behind the cutout as the camera moves."
0723-0,"The monster appears active due to an optical illusion created by its concave (hollowed-in) head structure. Our brains are strongly biased to interpret faces as convex (bulging out). When the viewer moves, the way perspective and features shift on the concave surface creates motion cues that the brain misinterprets as a convex head turning to follow the movement."
0723-1,"The monster seems to move because of the hollow-face optical illusion.

**Explanation:** The monster's face is actually concave (curved inward), but our brains have a strong bias to perceive faces and face-like objects as convex (bulging outward). This expectation overrides the actual depth information. As the viewer moves side-to-side, the way the features on the concave surface shift relative to the viewer creates motion parallax cues that the brain interprets as a *convex* face turning to follow them."
0723-2,"Yes, the little monster appears to move due to an optical illusion involving a concave surface.

This is known as the hollow-face illusion. The creature's face is painted or constructed on the *inside* (concave) surfaces of the cardboard structure. Our brains are strongly wired to perceive faces as convex (bulging outwards), so even though the surface is concave, we interpret it as convex. As the viewer moves, the changing perspective on this misinterpreted concave shape creates the compelling illusion that the head and eyes are turning to follow them."
0723-7,D
0723-3,"No, the movement is solely an optical illusion. The creature's head appears to turn and follow the camera as a result of the hollow-face illusion produced by its inside-out construction, rather than by any active manipulation."
0643-2,"No, it cannot be definitively concluded from the video.

The flag's movement is significantly influenced by the soldier unfurling and holding it, making it difficult to isolate the effect of wind direction from the action itself."
0643-0,"Based on the video, the wind direction cannot be reliably determined.

**Explanation:** The primary movement of the flag seen in the video is caused by the soldier actively unfurling it, lifting it upwards and outwards. After this initial action, the flag hangs predominantly downwards due to gravity, without showing significant or consistent billowing or fluttering that would clearly indicate the presence or direction of wind. The soldier's action and the flag's own weight are the dominant forces influencing its movement in this short clip."
0643-3,"**No.** The flag is billowing toward the right side of the screen. Flags billow *downwind*, meaning they show the direction the wind is traveling *to*. Therefore, the wind must be coming *from* the left side of the screen and blowing toward the right."
0643-1,"You cannot determine the wind direction from the video.

The flag is being actively held and raised by the soldier. Its movement is primarily caused by the soldier's actions rather than being solely influenced by natural wind currents, making it an unreliable indicator for wind direction in this context."
0643-7,D
0645-0,"Relative to the camera perspective, the left end of the scarf worn by the student character at the beginning of the video is located hanging vertically down the front of the student's body, on the right side of the screen (the student's left side) at the end of the video.

**Explanation:**
At the start, the student holds the scarf horizontally. The end on the left side from the camera's view is held in the student's right hand. After wrapping the scarf around their neck, this specific end hangs down vertically on the student's left side, which appears on the right side of the video frame from the camera's perspective."
0645-2,"No, the left end of the scarf does not remain on the left side of the student character's body at the end of the video. At the end (around 0:11-0:12), the student has tied the scarf so that the visible end hangs down on their right side."
0645-3,"No. At the end of the video, the end of the scarf that was initially held in the student character's left hand is hanging down on the left side of her body."
0645-1,"By the end of the video, the left end of the scarf (from the camera's perspective) hangs down in front of the student's body on her left side.

**Explanation:** The student wraps the scarf around her neck. The end she initially held in her right hand (which is the left end from the camera's view) goes around the back of her neck and ends up hanging down on her left side (camera's left)."
0645-7,B
0652-3,"Yes, the car ended up facing the opposite direction on the highway after the spin.

Explanation: The video shows the car losing control and spinning approximately 180 degrees on the wet road. This rotation resulted in the car coming to rest facing backwards relative to its original direction of travel."
0652-2,"No, the car did not end up in the innermost lane facing the correct direction. After spinning, the car came to rest near the right shoulder of the highway, facing backwards, opposite the direction of traffic flow."
0652-0,"The car started in the middle lane, spun counter-clockwise, and moved laterally to the left. It crossed its original lane (middle) and the adjacent left lane, coming to rest near the far left edge or shoulder of the highway."
0652-7,D
0652-1,"Based on the dashcam footage provided, the car’s final resting position cannot be determined.

**Explanation:**

The video clip ends while the car is still spinning and sliding across the highway lanes towards the right side. The footage cuts off before the car comes to a complete stop, so its final location after the spin concludes is not shown."
0658-0,"The rider on the right is faster during the race.
Explanation: The rider on the right gets a quicker start off the gate, accelerates faster down the ramp, and maintains a clear lead over the initial jumps and into the first turn."
0658-1,"**Answer:** The rider wearing darker clothing is quicker in the race.
**Explanation:** As soon as the starting gate drops (0:07), the rider in darker clothing, positioned on the right, immediately accelerates faster and pulls ahead of the rider in lighter clothing as they descend the starting ramp, establishing an early lead."
0658-2,"Yes, the rider in the predominantly black outfit achieved a faster start and maintained a lead during the early part of the BMX race."
0658-3,"No.

**Explanation:** The rider in the dark grey/black outfit demonstrates a faster start, immediately pulling ahead down the ramp and establishing a lead over the initial jumps. This lead is maintained and extended throughout the visible portion of the race track shown in the clip."
0658-7,A
0655-0,"The camera vehicle is likely moving slightly faster than the tow truck.

**Explanation:** To film the Batmobile smoothly from the side while panning along its length (moving from the rear towards the front), the camera vehicle needs to travel at a speed very similar to the tow truck, but fractionally faster to allow for adjustments and the forward tracking motion seen in the video."
0655-1,"They are moving at approximately the same speed. The camera vehicle is keeping pace alongside the tow truck to maintain a stable shot for filming, meaning their speeds must be matched."
0655-2,"No, the camera does not appear to be moving faster than the truck. It maintains a relatively consistent position alongside the truck, tracking its movement in parallel, which indicates they are traveling at approximately the same speed."
0655-3,"**No.** The camera appears to be moving alongside the tow truck at a very similar speed. This is necessary to keep the truck relatively stable and centered within the frame while filming, as the background moves past both."
0655-7,D
0664-0,"The woman rolled the dice 10 times. This was counted by observing each instance she threw the dice during her turn in the game ""Shut the Box"" until she successfully closed all the numbered tiles."
0664-3,"No, the woman did not roll the dice 11 times.

Explanation: By carefully watching the video and counting each instance the woman throws the dice onto the game board, the total number of rolls comes to exactly 10, culminating in her winning roll where she closes the final number 3 tile."
0664-2,"No, the woman did not roll the dice 9 times during the game. She rolled the dice 10 times in total during her turn to shut the box."
0664-1,"**Answer:** 10 times.

**Explanation:** By watching the video, we can count each instance the woman throws the two dice into the game box. She successfully throws the dice and flips down corresponding numbers ten times before clearing the board."
0664-7,B
0667-1,"There are 6 participants in the challenge shown in the video.

**Explanation:** The video shows a sequence where six different individuals each take a turn releasing a balloon from an upper level and attempting to run down the stairs to catch it before it hits the ground. Each of these six people actively participated in the challenge attempt."
0667-3,"No, there are not seven people participating in the challenge. The video consistently shows six individuals: one person on the upper level dropping the balloon and five people on the lower level watching or attempting to catch it."
0667-2,"Yes, there are six people participating in the challenge. The video shows six different individuals (Celine, Bram, Laura, Ise, Michiel, and Anna) each taking a turn to throw the balloon and attempt to hit it before it touches the ground."
0667-7,C
0667-0,"**6**

Explanation: The video shows six different individuals (Celine, Bram, Laura, Ise, Michiel, and Anna) taking turns throwing the red balloon from the upper level and running down the stairs to attempt to catch it before it hits the ground."
0670-2,"No, that statement is not true. The video shows several different children jumping off the dock into the water at different times."
0670-0,"2 children jumped into the water.

Explanation: The video shows two different children performing backflips off the dock into the water at timestamps 0:12-0:14 and 0:14-0:16."
0670-1,2. The video shows two distinct older boys jumping from the dock into the water.
0670-3,Yes. The video shows at least four older boys jumping off a floating dock into the water.
0670-7,B
0673-0,"There are 3 buckets containing real popcorn shown in the video.

Explanation: The two individuals in the back row each have a bucket of real popcorn. The female character in the front row also has a bucket containing real popcorn, although a fake sign is placed on top of it during the video."
0673-7,C
0673-3,"No, there are not four buckets of real popcorn shown in the video. Three people are shown with standard yellow popcorn buckets eating real popcorn. However, the person with green hair and a mask is holding popcorn attached to a red napkin, which they flip over to reveal a cardboard circle marked ""FAKE"", indicating their popcorn setup is not a real bucket of popcorn."
0673-1,"There are 3 buckets of actual popcorn visible in the video.

These belong to the girl in the front right seat and the two individuals seated in the row directly behind her (a man and a boy), all of whom are shown with standard yellow popcorn buckets containing real popcorn. The person with green hair initially has a fake popcorn prop, not a bucket of actual popcorn."
0673-2,Yes. There are two individuals sitting in the row behind the main action who are shown eating from their own buckets of popcorn.
0675-2,"No, the man on the left did not feel displeased. His facial expressions and body language throughout the video, including during the reveals, consistently showed amusement, smiling, and laughter, indicating he was enjoying the experience."
0675-3,"Yes, the man on the left appeared impressed and intrigued by the magic performance. His reactions throughout the video, such as smiling, laughing, widening his eyes in surprise (particularly during the thumb and flower tricks), and actively participating, indicate genuine engagement and amusement."
0675-0,"After the man on the right revealed how the magic tricks were performed, the man on the left appeared **amused and entertained**.

His reactions, including smiling, laughing, and sometimes showing mock surprise after the reveals, indicated he was enjoying the playful nature of the tricks and the performance itself. He seemed to be a willing participant sharing in the lighthearted fun, rather than someone genuinely fooled or upset by the simple illusions."
0675-1,"The man on the left reacted with amusement, laughter, and moments of exaggerated surprise (like wide eyes and an open mouth) depending on the specific trick being shown.

**Explanation:** His reactions appeared performative rather than genuinely shocked. He was likely collaborating with the man on the right (possibly his son), knew about the simple novelty magic tricks beforehand, and was playing along to make the demonstrations more entertaining and engaging for the video they were creating."
0675-7,B
0679-0,"She feels shocked and surprised.

This is evident from her reaction: her eyes widen significantly, her mouth drops open, and she abruptly stops eating to stare at where the man was sitting."
0679-2,"Yes, her reaction clearly shows surprise, as evidenced by her widened eyes and open mouth after the man unexpectedly removed his stool."
0679-3,"No. The woman's reaction, characterized by wide eyes, an open mouth, and pointing, indicates shock and surprise at the sudden and unexpected event of the stool seat falling off next to her, rather than feelings of being upset or frustrated."
0679-7,B
0679-1,The woman reacts with shock and surprise. This is evident from her wide eyes and open mouth as she realizes the stool has been removed and she is falling.
0689-0,"The man in the purple T-shirt changed the other man's lock screen wallpaper to his own photo as a lighthearted prank or practical joke.

**Explanation:** His actions, including selecting a funny photo of himself, his laughter afterwards, and the friend's surprised reaction, indicate the intention was to be funny, tease his friend, and create an amusing moment, likely for shared laughter or for content creation since it was being filmed."
0689-2,"Yes, the man in the purple T-shirt intentionally changed the smartphone's lock screen wallpaper to his own photo.

**Explanation:** The video shows him tapping on his own photo on the phone's screen, accessing a menu, and selecting an option which results in his photo being set as the lock screen wallpaper. He then takes the phone and shows it to the man in the black hoodie while laughing, indicating this was a deliberate action, likely intended as a prank to mislead or confuse the other man about the phone's ownership."
0689-3,"Yes, the man in the purple T-shirt changed the lock screen wallpaper to his own photo as a prank.

The video shows him selecting a photo of himself on the phone, interacting with the phone's options, and then revealing the lock screen displaying his picture. His laughter and the phone owner's surprised reaction confirm it was intended as a prank."
0689-7,A
0689-1,"The man in the purple T-shirt altered the lock screen wallpaper on the other man's phone to his own picture **to play a prank or joke on him.**

**Explanation:** His actions, including selecting a funny picture of himself, quickly changing the wallpaper while the owner wasn't looking closely, and his subsequent laughter and wink, indicate a playful and mischievous intent aimed at surprising and amusing the phone's owner."
0690-1,The child is lying on the floor watching the adults play a game on the coffee table.
0690-2,"Yes, the child is lying on the ground as a strategic part of the staged trick. This position allows the child to covertly reach up and take the money from the table while the adults are focused on the shuffling, thereby executing the ""disappearing money"" element of the performance."
0690-3,"The child is lying on the ground because they are **playing**.

**Explanation:** The child is actively watching the adults perform a shell game with bowls on the coffee table above them. They are looking up, appear engaged, and even interrupt the game at one point, indicating participation rather than passive relaxation."
0690-0,The child is lying on the ground to watch the game the adults are playing on the coffee table above her. She appears relaxed and engaged in observing their activity from that vantage point.
0690-7,C
0695-2,"Yes, the woman won the game. The off-screen voice announced ""Four"" after her final arrangement (Green, Blue, Purple, Orange), indicating all her cups were in the correct matching positions, which signifies a win in this game."
0695-1,"The woman emerged as the winner of the competition.

Explanation: The game involves matching the order of colored cups. An off-screen voice calls out the number of correctly placed cups after each player rearranges theirs. The woman wins because, on her final turn shown, the voice announces ""Four!"", indicating she successfully matched all four cups to the target sequence, and she celebrates her victory."
0695-7,A
0695-0,"**Winner:** The woman won the game.
**Explanation:** The game involves matching the order of four cups. A score of 4 indicates all cups are in the correct position, signifying a perfect match. The woman achieved a score of 4 on her final turn, while the man's highest score was 2. Therefore, the woman won by successfully matching the hidden sequence first."
0695-3,"No, the man did not win the game. The game is won by correctly guessing the opponent's cup sequence order, which relies on memory and deduction based on the feedback given after each turn, not on the speed of arranging the cups. The woman won this game by successfully matching the man's sequence."
0706-0,"The purpose of the man's actions in the first half of the video was **to record the base footage for adding special effects later.**

**Explanation:** He was performing the physical movements and poses required for the live-action component of the video. This raw footage was then used in post-production where visual effects, such as the energy effects, the shadow clone, and the ground cracking, were added to create the final edited sequence."
0706-2,Yes. The video clearly shows that the footage recorded in the first part was used as the foundation for the special effects sequence exhibited in the latter half of the video.
0706-1,"He is setting up his camera and recording himself performing specific, dynamic actions on the beach.

*   **Explanation:** This footage is being captured as the base material for a video project, likely one that will involve significant editing or special effects later on, which justifies the potentially awkward public performance mentioned in the text overlay."
0706-3,"Yes. The man is shown adjusting a camera on a tripod on the beach, then steps back and performs dynamic movements resembling martial arts practice or choreography in front of the camera."
0706-7,B
0707-1,"The person runs towards the camera to create a forced perspective shot.

By bringing the drink cup very close to the camera lens while they remain further back, it creates an optical illusion, making the drink appear disproportionately large for a moment."
0707-3,"No, the person is running *away* from the camera, not towards it.

**Purpose:** He runs away to create distance and position himself correctly within the camera's frame for the subsequent dance performance, ensuring his full body and movements are captured.

**Specific Actions:** After running away, he stops, turns 180 degrees to face the camera, walks back slightly towards the center of the frame, and then begins dancing while holding his iced coffee. His dance includes arm gestures, pointing, and footwork."
0707-0,"The purpose of the person running towards the camera is to execute a dynamic video transition.

This movement creates visual interest and leads directly into a close-up shot, effectively highlighting the beverage he is holding and making it the focal point after the initial performance."
0707-2,"No, the person is not running towards the camera solely for a post-production shot. The movement towards the camera to show the drink up close appears to be integrated into the dance choreography itself, executed as part of the overall performance."
0707-7,A
0721-1,"The man is raising his left hand palm-up, positioning it directly beneath the airplane's fuselage. His right arm is extended out to his side.

This pose uses forced perspective to create the illusion that he is holding or supporting the airplane."
0721-0,"The man in sunglasses appears to be holding a large airplane (a LOT Polish Airlines jet) in his hand.

**Explanation:** This is an optical illusion created using forced perspective. The man is standing in the foreground, much closer to the camera, while the airplane is actually far away in the background. By carefully aligning his hand with the distant plane from the camera's viewpoint, it creates the visual trick that he is holding or supporting the aircraft."
0721-2,"No, the man is not actually holding the airplane in his hand. This is a forced perspective optical illusion where the man is much closer to the camera than the airplane, creating the visual trick that he is supporting the aircraft."
0721-3,"No, the man in sunglasses is not holding a toy airplane in his hand.

This is an optical illusion created using forced perspective. The man is positioning his hand closer to the camera, making it appear as though he is holding the real, full-sized airplane which is actually flying much further away in the background."
0721-7,B
0708-0,"The cat's exaggerated expression in the final shot, resembling a scream or a very wide yawn/hiss, is a dramatic reaction to seeing the owner return with a large haul of new bath products immediately after the cat seemingly enacted ""revenge"" by making a mess of the old ones in the tub.

**Brief Explanation:** The cat's effort to sabotage bath time by ruining the products was rendered completely futile by the owner instantly restocking everything. The final expression conveys a mix of frustration, defiance, and perhaps resigned exasperation at the inevitability of future baths, all amplified for comedic effect."
0708-3,"No, the cat is not screaming because it is upset about the mess. The cat is yawning, which in this context is far more likely related to fatigue or relaxation after the stress of the bath, rather than an expression of anger about the messy bathtub."
0708-2,"Yes, the video strongly suggests the cat's exaggerated open-mouthed reaction occurs because it sees the large quantity of new bath products being brought in. The sequence shown implies the cat is reacting with shock or dismay immediately after the owner reveals numerous replacements, following the cat's earlier act of knocking products into the bath."
0708-1,"The cat appears to be ""yelling"" (accompanied by a laughter sound effect) in the final scene as a comedic way to portray its mischievous satisfaction. It suggests the cat is triumphantly pleased with the chaos it created by knocking the bath products into the tub, framing its actions as a successful prank."
0708-7,C
0725-2,"Yes, the drink level is decreasing because the balloon inside the bottle is deflating. As the balloon deflates, it takes up less space (volume) inside the bottle, allowing the liquid to fill the volume that the inflated balloon previously occupied, causing the visible liquid level to drop."
0725-0,"The drink level in the bottle decreases because a hidden balloon inside the bottle deflates. Initially, the inflated balloon is submerged in the drink, displacing it and making the level appear higher. When the air is let out of the balloon through the straw, the balloon shrinks, taking up less space. The drink then fills the volume previously occupied by the inflated balloon, causing the overall liquid level to drop."
0725-3,"No, the drink level is not decreasing because it is being consumed through the straw.

The man is blowing air into the bottle through the straw, which creates bubbles in the liquid. He is not sucking the liquid out, so the volume of the drink remains unchanged."
0725-1,"The liquid level drops because deflating the balloon inside the bottle rapidly increases the volume of the air space above the liquid. This increase in volume causes a significant drop in the air pressure inside the bottle. The external atmospheric pressure, which is now higher than the internal pressure, pushes the liquid out of the bottle through the straw."
0725-7,A
0729-1,"The black strip appears longer. This is due to the Jastrow optical illusion, where the brain compares the longer, outer edge of the bottom (red) strip to the shorter, inner edge of the top (black) strip, creating a perceptual distortion that makes the top strip seem longer."
0729-2,"No, the black strip is not the longest among the strips shown in the video.

The visual comparison using the blue strip demonstrates that the blue strip is identical in size to the red strip. When the blue strip is compared to the black strip by aligning their top edges, the blue strip extends further down, indicating it (and therefore the red strip) is longer than the black strip."
0729-7,B
0729-3,No. The video explicitly indicates through a checkmark that the black strip is considered longer than the red strip.
0729-0,"The red strip is the shortest.

**Explanation:**
The video demonstrates this by using a blue strip, shown to be the same size as the red strip. When this blue strip is aligned with the inner curve of the black strip, the outer curve and ends of the black strip extend noticeably further than the blue (and therefore red) strip, indicating the black strip is longer and the red strip is shorter."
0724-2,"Yes, the banknote remains intact because the way it is folded creates a hidden opening or channel. The pen actually passes through this gap between the folded layers, giving the illusion that it's piercing the middle of the note without causing any damage."
0724-7,B
0724-3,"Yes, the banknote is not broken because the pen likely has a hidden mechanism or is a specially designed prop. This type of pen often features a break, slot, or magnetic component that allows the banknote to pass through a gap within the pen itself, creating the illusion of penetration while leaving the banknote unharmed."
0724-1,"The pen appears to go through the banknote without tearing it because of how the note is folded and clever manipulation.

**How the Banknote is Folded:**
The banknote is typically folded in half lengthwise, and then folded in half again widthwise. This creates multiple layers (usually four) stacked together in the center.

**Brief Explanation:**
The pen doesn't actually pierce the paper. When the banknote is folded this way, the performer secretly guides the pen tip to slide *between* the central layers of the folded bill. The folds hide this action and create a natural separation or channel for the pen to pass through from one side to the other. When the banknote is unfolded, it appears completely unharmed because no hole was ever made."
0724-0,"The pen appears to pass through the banknote without breaking it because it doesn't actually pierce the paper. Instead, it slides through a hidden channel created by a specific folding technique.

Here's how the banknote is typically folded:

1.  **First Fold:** The banknote is folded in half lengthwise (like a hot dog bun).
2.  **Second Fold:** It is then folded in half widthwise (like a hamburger bun). However, this second fold is made *unevenly* or *offset*. One side of the folded note is deliberately made slightly shorter than the other, not meeting the edge perfectly.

**Brief Explanation:** This offset in the second fold creates a small gap or channel running along the main crease, hidden between the layers of the folded bill. The pen is inserted into this channel and slid through it. To the audience, it looks like the pen is penetrating the solid, folded banknote, but it's actually just passing through the pre-made gap. When the banknote is unfolded, it's undamaged because the pen never went through the paper itself."
0731-1,"The old man's nose represents a **mermaid sitting on a rock**.

**Explanation:** The figure of the mermaid, along with the rock she is perched upon, is positioned centrally within the hidden profile of the old man's face. The shape and placement of the mermaid and rock cleverly mimic the structure of a human nose when viewed as part of the larger optical illusion."
0731-0,"Based on dual perception, the old man's nose also looks like a mermaid sitting on a rock in the sea.

**Explanation:** The painting uses elements of the seascape to form the features of the old man's face. The specific area that constitutes the nose in the larger profile view is simultaneously painted as a detailed scene of a mermaid resting on a rock formation emerging from the water."
0731-3,"No, the old man's nose could not convincingly be perceived as the head and beak of a bird.

**Explanation:** The painting clearly depicts a distinct bird forming the forehead and hair of the old man's profile. The element forming the nose is rendered with the texture and angular shape of a rock formation, consistent with the surrounding landscape elements used to create the face. It lacks the specific features, such as an eye or the characteristic structure of a bird's head and beak, separate from the prominent bird already present in the composition. Its primary function within the optical illusion is to serve as the nose of the old man."
0731-2,"Yes, the old man's nose can be seen as a mermaid sitting on a reef (or rock). In the optical illusion, the figure of the mermaid perched on the rock is positioned and shaped to form the nose within the larger profile of the man's face."
0731-7,A
0735-1,"The scenery appears on the artboard because the artboard is actually a mirror reflecting the real sunset landscape.

**Explanation:** The artist positions a mirror on an easel to capture the reflection of the sunset over the water. He then uses a paintbrush dipped in water to draw a line across the mirror's surface. The water applied to the mirror distorts the reflection below the line, creating the illusion that the water portion of the scene is painted, while the sky above remains a clear reflection."
0735-2,"Yes. The surface on the easel is a mirror, and it is reflecting the actual sunset landscape over the water where the scene is being filmed."
0735-0,"The scenery on the artboard is actually a reflection of the real landscape. A mirror was placed on the easel instead of a canvas, and it was positioned to reflect the sunset scene over the water. The person then pretends to paint this reflection with a brush to create the illusion of an artwork."
0735-7,B
0735-3,"**Answer:** No
**Explanation:** The segment shows a man using a brush on a board placed before the actual sunset. The final shot reveals a completed image *on the board* that mimics the sunset, indicating the focus is on this representation (likely a reflection, screen, or pre-existing image revealed for effect) rather than the act of painting it live during the sunset."
0740-0,"Multiply 4 by 4.
*   Explanation: Following PEMDAS and the left-to-right rule for multiplication and division as shown in the video:
    1.  Parentheses: (2 + 2) = 4. The expression becomes 8 ÷ 2(4).
    2.  Division (left-most operation): 8 ÷ 2 = 4. The expression becomes 4(4).
    3.  Multiplication: 4 * 4 = 16. This is the third calculation step performed."
0740-2,"Yes, the third step shown in the video is performing the multiplication of 4 × 4.

**Explanation:**
1.  **Parentheses:** The first step solves the operation inside the parentheses: (2 + 2) = 4. The expression becomes 8 ÷ 2(4).
2.  **Division (Left to Right):** Following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) and performing multiplication and division from left to right, the next step is 8 ÷ 2 = 4. The expression becomes 4(4).
3.  **Multiplication:** The third and final step is the multiplication: 4 × 4 = 16."
0740-7,D
0740-1,"The third step is multiplying 4 by 4.
**Explanation:** Following the PEMDAS order as demonstrated in the video:
1.  **Parentheses:** (2 + 2) = 4. The expression becomes 8 ÷ 2(4).
2.  **Division (Left to Right):** 8 ÷ 2 = 4. The expression becomes 4(4).
3.  **Multiplication (Left to Right):** 4(4) = 16. This multiplication is the third step in the calculation process shown."
0740-3,"Yes, the third step shown in the video is performing the division of 8 ÷ 2.

**Explanation:** After calculating the parentheses (2 + 2 = 4), the expression becomes 8 ÷ 2(4). According to the PEMDAS/BODMAS order of operations, multiplication and division have equal priority and are performed from left to right. Therefore, the leftmost operation, 8 ÷ 2, is performed next, resulting in 4."
0738-2,"No, the man in the video changed the scene from bright to dark, not black to bright. He intentionally lowered the camera's exposure setting by dragging his finger downwards on the screen after locking focus on the bright sunset, resulting in a darker, more silhouetted image."
0738-3,"No, the man in the video did not use a time-lapse feature. He manually adjusted the exposure setting on his phone while recording the video. After tapping the screen to lock focus and exposure (indicated by the yellow box), he dragged his finger downwards, which decreased the brightness of the scene in real-time, making the sky appear darker, not brighter."
0738-0,"The man tapped the screen to lock the focus and exposure (AE/AF Lock) on the sunset. He then manually lowered the exposure compensation by dragging his finger down the screen, causing the live preview on his phone to become very dark. The final recorded video appears bright because the phone likely captured the scene using its standard settings or HDR capabilities, recording more light information than the deliberately underexposed preview showed, or the footage was brightened in editing."
0738-1,"The man used the phone's camera controls to manually underexpose the scene before recording.

Here's a brief explanation:
1.  He first tapped and held on the screen. This action locks the camera's Auto Exposure and Auto Focus (AE/AF Lock).
2.  Once locked, a vertical slider (often with a sun icon) appeared, allowing manual exposure adjustment.
3.  He dragged this slider downwards, significantly decreasing the exposure and making the image dark.
4.  He then started recording the video with this intentionally low exposure setting, creating the initial dark appearance. The scene likely brightens as the exposure is gradually increased back to normal *after* recording begins (though this adjustment phase isn't shown in the setup)."
0738-7,A
0742-0,"**Answer:**

*   **18**

**Explanation:**

1.  The diagram shows a right angle (indicated by the square symbol), which measures 90°.
2.  This right angle is composed of three smaller angles: x°, 2x°, and 2x°.
3.  The sum of these three angles must equal 90°.
4.  Set up the equation: x + 2x + 2x = 90.
5.  Combine the terms with x: 5x = 90.
6.  To find the value of x, divide both sides of the equation by 5: x = 90 / 5.
7.  Calculate the result: x = 18."
0742-2,"Yes, the value of x is 18.

The diagram shows three adjacent angles (x°, 2x°, and 2x°) that together form a right angle (indicated by the square symbol), which measures 90°. Therefore, the sum of these angles must equal 90°:
x + 2x + 2x = 90°
Combining the terms gives:
5x = 90°
Dividing both sides by 5 yields:
x = 18°"
0742-7,B
0742-1,"To determine the value of x, recognize that the angles labeled x°, 2x°, and 2x° are adjacent to a right angle (90°, indicated by the square symbol) and together they form a straight line. Angles on a straight line sum to 180°. Therefore, the sum of x°, 2x°, and 2x° must equal the remaining portion of the straight angle, which is 180° - 90° = 90°.

Set up the equation:
x + 2x + 2x = 90

Combine the like terms:
5x = 90

Solve for x by dividing both sides by 5:
x = 90 / 5
x = 18"
0742-3,"No, the value of x is not 25.

**Brief explanation:**
The diagram shows three angles (x°, 2x°, and 2x°) that add up to a right angle (90°). Therefore, the equation is x + 2x + 2x = 90. Combining like terms gives 5x = 90. Dividing both sides by 5 results in x = 18."
0743-0,The answer to the third math question (13+13) is 26. This is because adding 13 to itself results in 26.
0743-2,"Yes. The third math question presented in the video is 13+13. The man confidently points to the option ""26"" and exclaims ""Yes!"", indicating it is the correct answer he has chosen. Mathematically, 13 plus 13 equals 26."
0743-1,"The solution to the third math problem (13 + 13) is 26. This is because adding 13 to itself equals 26, which matches one of the options presented in the video."
0743-3,"No, the answer to the third math question in the video is not 25.

**Explanation:** The third math question presented in the video is 13+13. The two options shown are 25 and 26. The person in the video selects 26 as the answer."
0743-7,C
0749-0,"In the first physics experiment shown, both the white granular substance (like rice or grains) and the yellow liquid pass through the sieve (skimmer).

The grains pass through because their individual size is small enough to fall through the openings in the mesh. The liquid passes through because it can easily flow through the openings."
0749-1,"The fine white powder is able to pass through the sieve.

This occurs because the individual particles of the powder are smaller than the openings in the sieve's mesh, allowing them to fall through, while the larger rice grains are retained by the mesh."
0749-2,"No, the coated rice does not pass through the sieve (skimmer). The yellow substance seen is liquid egg wash, not coarse grain. The egg wash and subsequent powder coating cause the rice grains to adhere together, forming a cohesive mass that is too large to fall through the openings of the skimmer."
0749-3,"Yes, flour would pass upwards through the sieve in this type of experiment.

**Explanation:** This happens due to Bernoulli's Principle. When air is blown rapidly *across* the top surface of the sieve, the speed of the air increases above the sieve openings. Faster-moving air exerts lower pressure. The relatively still air beneath the sieve (among the flour particles) would be at a higher pressure. This pressure difference (higher below, lower above) creates an upward force (lift) sufficient to push the lightweight flour particles up through the holes of the sieve. (Note: The video demonstrates this principle with rice grains.)"

0757-0,"**Answer:** The boy in red's **right foot** steps on or very close to the soccer ball.

**Explanation:** Between timestamps 0:03 and 0:05, the boy in red approaches the ball and brings his right foot down directly over or beside the ball."
0757-7,B
0757-1,"**Answer:** The boy in red steps into the pit/dark patch with his **right foot**.
**Explanation:** As the boy in the red jersey approaches the ball around the 3-second mark, the video clearly shows him placing his right foot onto the dark patch of ground while his left foot remains on the grass."
0757-2,"**Answer:** Yes.

**Explanation:**
The video shows the boy in the red shirt stepping forward to control the ball. His left foot lands directly onto the dark patch on the grass, and it visibly sinks into the substance."
0757-3,"Yes, the boy in red steps directly into the pile of dark material with his right foot as he attempts to trap the ball."
0762-0,"The second boat was made of paper or cardboard.

**Explanation:** The video displays emojis representing the materials for each boat test. The second emoji shown is a stack of paper (📄). The second test features a white, box-like structure corresponding to this emoji, which immediately collapses and sinks when the person steps onto it."
0762-2,"Yes, the second boat appears to be made of paper or a similar material like cardboard. This is strongly suggested by its immediate collapse and sinking the moment the person steps onto it, demonstrating a lack of structural integrity consistent with wet paper under load. The associated paper emoji further supports this interpretation."
0762-1,"The second boat appears to be made of **Expanded Polystyrene (EPS), commonly known as Styrofoam**.

**Explanation:** The boat is a large, white block that floats very high on the water, indicating a very low-density, highly buoyant material like Styrofoam. Its immediate instability and tendency to flip when the person steps on it are characteristic of a lightweight block lacking the stabilizing shape and ballast of a proper boat hull."
0762-7,C
0762-3,"No, the second boat is not made of a mattress. The highlighted emoji for the second attempt is the paper/sheets emoji (📄), and the white object used sinks immediately, consistent with paper or sheets rather than a mattress."
0763-2,"No. The hand removes a 2D drawing designed to look like the can, which creates an optical illusion. The actual, real Coca-Cola can remains untouched on the surface."
0763-3,"No, we cannot conclude with certainty that the remaining can is a real canned Coke.

**Explanation:** The video's explicit theme is optical illusions and how our perception can be deceived. Therefore, despite the visual appearance of a simple action (adding and removing a second can), the context makes it impossible to be sure. The remaining can could be a hyperrealistic drawing, a prop, or part of an unrevealed visual trick, casting doubt on its authenticity as a genuine physical object."
0763-0,"The canned Coke that is still in the picture is real.

**Explanation:** The video shows a hand placing a second, identical can next to the original can. The hand then picks up and removes the original can, leaving the second can (the one it just placed) on the table."
0763-7,C
0763-1,"Both the can that was removed and the can left in the image are genuine. The video presents both as real, physical Coca-Cola cans, using them as straightforward examples of how the eye perceives actual 3D shapes before demonstrating various optical illusions."
0766-1,"The archer released the bow from her right shoulder. She draws the bowstring back towards her right shoulder using a mouth-held release aid, and the release occurs from this drawn position."
0766-0,"The archer does not use a shoulder to release the bow in the conventional sense. She uses a release aid operated by her mouth/chin area to release the bowstring, while holding and stabilizing the bow with her foot and leg."
0766-2,"No, the archer did not release the bow using their right shoulder.

**Explanation:** The video shows the archer using a specialized technique where the release is initiated by a mouth-held trigger mechanism. She draws the bowstring using her shoulder and upper body (connected via a strap), but the actual release of the arrow occurs when she activates the trigger device held in her mouth, likely using her jaw."
0766-3,"No. The archer, Sheetal Devi, uses a specialized pink mouth-operated release aid to trigger the arrow release, not her shoulder."
0766-7,B

**Explanation:** Each distinct successful trick attempt shown in the compilation video counts as one trick shot. Counting these individual successful shots throughout the video results in a total of 14."
0777-0,"There are 14 successful trick shots shown in total.

**Explanation:**

The video compiles various trick shots performed over time. Each distinct successful attempt shown counts as one shot:

0779-0,"The illusion achieved in the video is a physical representation of the **Penrose Triangle**, also known as an impossible triangle.

This illusion is created using **forced perspective**. The orange object is not actually a solid, continuous triangle made of cubes. Instead, it's a carefully constructed sculpture with specific angles, gaps, and disconnected parts. When viewed from one precise angle (as shown initially), these separate elements align perfectly to trick the eye into perceiving a complete, closed, three-dimensional triangular structure composed of cubes joined at right angles – something geometrically impossible in reality. Rotating the object reveals its true, non-impossible construction and breaks the illusion by showing how the parts are actually arranged in space."
0779-2,"Yes.

**Explanation:**
The video shows an object that initially appears to be a Penrose Triangle constructed from nine interconnected orange cubes when viewed from a specific angle. However, as the object is rotated, it is revealed to be a single, cleverly designed piece whose angled surfaces and cutouts only create the illusion of cubes from that particular viewpoint. It is not actually made of separate cubes."
0779-1,"**Illusion:** The object creates the visual illusion of a Penrose Triangle, which is an impossible object, seemingly constructed from nine interconnected cubes.

**Explanation:** This illusion is achieved through **forced perspective**. The physical object is not actually an impossible shape made of nine complete cubes. Instead, it's a single, cleverly designed 3D piece with specific angles, cuts, and potentially disconnected parts. When viewed from one particular angle (as shown at the start of the video), these features align perfectly, tricking the eye and brain into perceiving a continuous, closed triangular loop with impossible right-angle turns. Rotating the object reveals its true, non-impossible physical structure and breaks the illusion."
0779-3,"No, the illusion is not achieved by aligning separate blocks.

**Explanation:** The object shown in the video is a single, solid piece, likely 3D printed. It is cleverly designed so that when viewed from a specific angle, its different facets and edges align perfectly to create the visual deception of multiple interconnected blocks forming a continuous triangle (similar to a Penrose triangle). Rotating the object reveals its true, single-piece structure and shows that it is not actually constructed from separate blocks. The effect relies on forced perspective from that particular viewpoint."

0790-0,"**Orient the sheet vertically.**

*   **Explanation:** The sheet acts as a polarizing filter. When the sheet is oriented vertically, its transmission axis aligns with the vertical blue tube. This allows the light reflected from or passing through the blue tube (which is effectively vertically aligned in this context) to pass through the filter, making the blue tube visible. Conversely, this vertical orientation blocks the light from the horizontal red and green tubes, making them disappear behind the sheet."
0790-7,D
0790-1,"To make the blue tube visible through the transparent sheet, the sheet needs to be rotated 90 degrees from its initial horizontal position so that it is held vertically.

**Explanation:** The video demonstrates that when the sheet is held horizontally, the vertical blue tube disappears. However, when the sheet is rotated and held vertically (aligned parallel to the blue tube and perpendicular to the red and green tubes), the blue tube becomes clearly visible through the sheet, while the horizontal red and green tubes disappear behind it."
0790-2,"Yes, rotating the transparent sheet by 90 degrees will make the blue tube visible.

**Explanation:**
The transparent sheet is a polarizing filter. When it's oriented horizontally, it blocks the light associated with the vertical blue tube, making it disappear while allowing the horizontal red and green tubes to be seen. Rotating the sheet 90 degrees aligns its polarization axis with the vertical blue tube, allowing its light to pass through, thus making it visible. Simultaneously, this vertical orientation blocks the light associated with the horizontal red and green tubes, causing them to disappear where covered by the sheet."
0790-3,"No, rotating the transparent sheet by 45 degrees does not make the blue tube clearly visible. According to the video demonstration, rotating the sheet to 45 degrees causes all the tubes behind it to appear blurred and indistinct (as shown around 0:29). The blue tube is clearly visible only when the sheet is held vertically (rotated 90 degrees from the initial horizontal position), aligning with the blue tube's orientation (shown around 0:19)."
0794-1,"The ""friend"" described in the caption refers to **the dogs** on the ground level.

**Explanation:** The white cat jumps down from the ledge, presumably to join the dogs below. However, as soon as the cat lands, both dogs immediately turn and run away, abandoning the cat. This act of fleeing is interpreted as the untrustworthy behavior the caption warns against."
0794-2,"No, the 'friend' in the caption is not the white cat that leaves quickly at the start.

The caption ""POV: Never trust your friend 💀"" appears just before the camera focuses on the second cat (white with black spots) contemplating and then jumping down from the ledge. This timing and focus strongly suggest the caption refers to this second cat and its action, rather than the first cat which disappears almost immediately."
0794-0,"The caption ""Never trust your friend"" is referring to the **white cat**.

**Explanation:** The video is shot from a first-person perspective (POV) on a ledge. The white cat is the only other creature present on the ledge with the camera before it suddenly falls. The caption implies that this ""friend"" (the cat) caused the fall, hence the warning not to trust them. The dogs only appear after the camera has already fallen to the ground."
0794-3,"Yes, the 'friend' in the caption likely refers to the black dog.

The caption ""POV: Never trust your friend 💀"" sets up an expectation of betrayal from the perspective of the white cat. When the cat jumps down from the ledge, the black dog immediately runs towards it in a chasing manner. This sudden, seemingly aggressive action following the cat's landing is presented as the betrayal of trust implied by the caption."

0806-0,"Four cables were bundled together.

They are identifiable by their colors: black, white, red/black braided, and grey."
0806-1,"Four cables were bundled together.

**Explanation:**

The video shows four distinct cables (one black, one white, one red/black braided, and one grey) laid out individually before they are gathered and wrapped together using the spiral wrap."
0806-2,"Yes, the video shows four distinct cables (black, white, red/black braided, and grey) being gathered and bundled together using a spiral plastic strip that was created earlier in the video."
0806-7,A
0806-3,"False. The video shows four cables (one black, one white, one red/black patterned, and one grey) being bundled together using the spiral wrap."
0810-1,"The sausage appeared 5 times.

It popped up sequentially from different holes in the board throughout the video clip."
0810-3,"No, the sausage did not pop up only three times. It appeared a total of six times from different holes in the board."
0810-0,"The sausage popped up 5 times.

This was determined by watching the video and counting each instance the sausage emerged from one of the holes in the wooden board."
0810-7,D
0810-2,"No, the sausage did not emerge five times. It emerged from the holes four times."
0812-2,"No, the person did not try to place the toy into a drawer three times. The person pushed the plush toy upwards into the space under the desk four times."
0812-1,"The person made **6** attempts to put the toy into the **bag** (not a drawer).

This count observes the distinct forward pushing motions the person made trying to get the plush toy into the opening of the bag hanging from the desk."
0812-3,"No, the person did not try to place the toy into a drawer 10 times. The video shows the person repeatedly pushing a hanging plush cockatiel keychain approximately 9-10 times. There is no drawer visible, and the action involves pushing the toy, not placing it anywhere."
0812-0,"The person tried to place the toy into the bag approximately 9-10 times.

**Explanation:** The video shows the person grabbing the yellow bird keychain (which is attached to a bag, not a drawer) and then rapidly pushing it towards the opening of the bag multiple times in quick succession between the 0:08 and 0:13 mark. Counting the fast movements suggests about 9 or 10 distinct pushes."
0812-7,C
0816-3,"No. In the second trial (0:09-0:15), the person swirled the water in the bottle to create a vortex, allowing it to drain faster without inserting a straw. The straw was only used in the third trial."
0816-1,"**Action:** The person swirled the inverted bottle in a circular motion.

**Explanation:** This swirling action created a vortex (whirlpool) inside the bottle. The vortex provided a stable, central channel for air to enter the bottle while water flowed out around the edges simultaneously, allowing the bottle to drain much more quickly and smoothly."
0816-0,"In the second experiment, the person swirled the bottle before inverting it.

**Explanation:** This swirling action created a vortex (whirlpool) inside the bottle. The vortex formed a stable air channel through the center of the water, allowing air to enter the bottle continuously as the water flowed out around the channel. This simultaneous exchange of air entering and water exiting significantly reduced the emptying time compared to simply inverting the bottle, where air has to intermittently bubble up against the outflowing water."
0816-2,"Yes, in the second experiment, the person swirled the inverted water bottle. This action generated a visible vortex, which allowed air to enter the bottle more easily while the water exited, significantly speeding up the draining process."

0818-0,"The little girl was holding play money in her hand. It appears to be a pretend dollar bill, likely used as currency for their homemade claw machine game."
0818-3,"No, the little girl is not holding a small bottle. She is holding folded paper money in her hand."
0818-1,"The little girl is holding folded paper money. It appears to be play money, intended as payment for the pretend claw machine game they are playing."
0818-2,"No, the little girl is not holding real cash. She appears to be holding play money as part of the pretend claw machine game they are playing."

0827-0,"*   **Count:** 1
*   **Explanation:** The video clip starting around 0:04 shows one real giant panda interacting with a person in a costume."
0827-1,There are **two pandas** shown in the video. The clip includes a scene with one adult giant panda and one giant panda cub.
0827-3,"Yes, the second clip in the video (starting around 0:04) shows an adult giant panda interacting with a baby giant panda."
0827-2,"No, the indoor segment shows two real pandas—an adult giant panda and a baby giant panda."

0835-1,"A blue tongue stud can be seen. This is a piece of jewelry piercing her tongue, visible when her mouth is open during the adjustment."
0835-3,"**No**, there is no dental appliance or mouth guard visible in the woman's mouth. The only object visible inside her mouth appears to be a tongue piercing stud."
0835-2,"Yes, there is a blue tongue stud visible in the woman's mouth. A small, round blue object can be clearly seen on the surface of her tongue when her mouth is open during the adjustment, particularly around the 0:10-0:15 and 0:41-0:50 mark."
0835-7,D
0835-0,"Visible in the woman's mouth are her teeth, her tongue, and a small, round tongue piercing stud on the surface of her tongue. These are observable when she opens her mouth during the adjustment procedure."
0841-0,"The woman wiped her **left eye** with the parrot first.

**Explanation:** Around the 0:02-0:03 mark in the video, while the woman is still wearing her glasses, the parrot is brought to her face and dabs the area near her left eye. She subsequently removes her glasses and then uses the parrot on her right eye."
0841-1,"The woman used the parrot to wipe her **left eye** first.

**Explanation:** In the video, at approximately the 0:03 timestamp, she brings the parrot to her left eye (the eye on the viewer's right) to wipe away tears before moving to her right eye later around the 0:07 mark."
0841-2,"No. The video shows the woman using the parrot to wipe tears exclusively from her left eye and cheek area, not her right eye."
0841-7,B
0841-3,"No, the woman did not wipe her left eye first. She first wiped her right eye with the parrot at the 0:07 mark in the video."
0833-3,"No, the fourth segment does not show a person holding a glass jar with a drink. It shows a behind-the-scenes look at creating a levitation photo effect under a pier."
0833-2,"Yes, the fourth segment (approximately 0:18-0:24) shows the process and the final edited photograph where a man is lying on the sand under a pier, and a translucent image of him appears to be floating above his body, resembling a soul."
0833-7,D
0833-0,"The photo in the fourth segment aims to show a man appearing to levitate horizontally above his own body lying on the sand under a pier.

This is a photographic illusion created by taking separate shots – one of the man lying down and another of him balanced on a stool (which is later digitally removed) – and then combining them in editing to create the final surreal image of levitation."
0833-1,"The fourth segment depicts the creation of a levitation illusion photograph. It shows the setup process where a person lies on the sand under a pier and is assisted onto a stool, followed by the final edited image where the person is seen lying on the sand while a semi-transparent version of their body appears to float horizontally above them."
0854-0,"The operator deliberately talks with the riders to distract them and lull them into a false sense of security. By engaging them in casual conversation, sometimes even pretending the ride is malfunctioning, the operator ensures the riders aren't mentally prepared for the sudden drop. When the operator abruptly activates the ride, the element of surprise significantly intensifies the feeling of fear and thrill, making the experience more memorable because they are caught completely off guard."
0854-2,"Yes.

**Explanation:**

The operator chats casually with riders or sometimes tells them the machine is malfunctioning, only to suddenly activate the drop when they are distracted or feeling anxious. This catches them off guard and intensifies the experience by increasing their nervousness and anticipation right before the fall."
0854-1,"The operator talks to the visitors to distract them and lower their guard. By engaging them in casual conversation or even pretending there's a machine malfunction, the operator prevents the riders from mentally bracing for the imminent drop. This makes the sudden fall more surprising and intense, enhancing the thrill of the ride."
0854-3,"No, the operator's conversation is not meant to help visitors feel more at ease or prepared.

The operator deliberately uses conversation, and sometimes even feigns malfunctions, as a tactic to distract riders and catch them off guard, thereby enhancing the surprise and thrill of the sudden drop."
0854-7,D
0848-2,"Yes, the real cat is the one at the top of the frame. Its movement is dynamic and three-dimensional, showing distinct leg motions and body shifts characteristic of a walking animal, while the bottom silhouette is a flat, distorted projection consistent with being its shadow cast on the surface below."
0848-3,"Yes, the real cat in the video is the one on top, casting a shadow below.

The top figure is the physical cat, a three-dimensional object blocking light. The bottom figure is the two-dimensional shadow cast onto the surface beneath the cat as a result of this light obstruction."
0848-0,"The top figure is the real cat (the 'void cat').

**Explanation:** The top silhouette exhibits the three-dimensional movement and form of a physical cat walking, while the bottom silhouette is flatter, slightly distorted, and moves as a projection onto the surface below, consistent with being a shadow cast by the cat above it."
0848-7,D
0848-1,"The **top** silhouette is the actual cat.

**Explanation:** The top shape moves with the distinct, three-dimensional gait and form of a walking cat. The bottom shape is a flat, slightly distorted projection on the ground that perfectly mimics the top shape's movement, which is characteristic of a shadow being cast by the object above it."
0857-0,"The woman's actions appear to imitate a combination of scenarios:

1.  **Trust Fall (Solo/Failed):** Her initial backward lean before falling strongly mimics the setup for a trust fall exercise, but without anyone there to catch her.
2.  **Skiing/Snowboarding/Sandboarding Wipeout:** The way she tumbles and slides down the sand dune after the initial lean resembles losing control and falling while participating in these types of slope activities.
3.  **General Playfulness/Tumbling:** Overall, the actions convey a sense of fun and simply enjoying the act of tumbling down the soft sand dune, much like a child playing on a hill."
0857-1,"The woman in the video is depicting **playfulness, joy, and a carefree attitude**.

**Explanation:** Her actions of repeatedly and deliberately falling backward and sliding down the sand dune are not accidental but intentional acts of play. The energetic way she throws herself into the movement, gets up, and repeats it in the scenic, sunny environment suggests she is expressing happiness, freedom, and a lack of inhibition, simply enjoying the physical sensation and the fun of the moment."
0857-3,"No, the woman is not imitating the act of fainting.

Her actions appear deliberate, controlled, and playful. She repeatedly leans back and slides or rolls down the sand dune, which is consistent with recreational activity in such an environment, rather than mimicking a sudden, involuntary loss of consciousness associated with fainting. The movements are intentional and lack the characteristics of a genuine faint."
0857-2,"No. The video shows a woman, not a man. She is playfully falling and sliding down a sand dune. Her movements appear to be intentional actions related to enjoying the activity on the dune, rather than mimicking the specific event of being shot. The context suggests recreation and fun."
0857-7,D
0858-2,"Yes, the man in the white short-sleeved shirt did initially sit on the right armrest of the chair.

The video explains that this is an optical illusion. While it appears from the initial camera angle that he is sitting on the left armrest, the narration clarifies that he actually sat on the right armrest due to the chair's deceptive design and the viewing perspective."
0858-3,"No, the man in the white short-sleeved shirt did not initially sit on the left armrest of the chair. Although it appeared that way due to an optical illusion created by the chair's design and the camera angle, the video's narration clarifies that he actually sat on the right armrest."
0858-7,C
0858-1,"The man in the white short-sleeved shirt did not try to sit on an armrest. He sat directly on the seat portion of the chair structure, using the armrests for support as he lowered himself onto the seat."
0858-0,"The man sat on the **right** armrest.

**Explanation:** Although the initial camera angle creates an optical illusion making it seem like he is sitting on the left armrest, the narrator clarifies that he actually sat on the chair's right armrest."
0865-1,"Two worms can be seen at the conclusion of the video.

Explanation: Both the brownish worm-like creature and the greenish caterpillar-like creature are still visible on the ground near the bird as the video ends; neither was eaten."
0865-0,"At the end of the video, there are 2 worm-like creatures.

**Explanation:** One is a brown earthworm, and the other is a green caterpillar or larva, both visible on the ground near the bird."
0865-2,"No, there is not only one worm visible. Besides the light-brown worm the bird is interacting with, there is also a small, green object nearby that resembles a caterpillar or larva, making two potential prey items visible."
0865-3,"No, that is incorrect. While two worms are visible on the ground at the end of the video, the bird's beak is empty."
0865-7,D
0868-1,The tool used by the person at the start of the video is a screwdriver with a **red** handle and a metallic **grey/silver** shaft with a dark tip.
0868-2,"Yes, the tool swung between 0:02 and 0:03 is a hammer. It has a silver-colored metal head and a brownish handle, consistent with the description."
0868-3,"No. The tool the person swings is a hammer, which has a wooden handle and a metal head, neither of which is red."
0868-0,The tool swung at the beginning of the video is a screwdriver. It has a red handle and a silver/metallic shaft.
0868-7,C
0870-3,"No, the man did not give any of his belongings to the photographer. The video shows the photographer providing the man and child with food, money, snacks, drinks, and an umbrella, but the man does not give any personal items in exchange; he only receives assistance."
0870-1,"Based on the video, the man did not voluntarily hand over his belongings (the piece of cardboard and the woven hat). The photographer is shown actively taking these items from the man while he was using them to shield himself and the child from the rain. Therefore, the man was not motivated to hand them over; they were taken from him, which visibly increased his distress."
0870-7,C
0870-0,"Based on the video, the man did not give his belongings to the photographer. Instead, the photographer provided the man and child with food, money, snacks, drinks, and an umbrella to help them with their immediate needs for food and shelter from the rain. The man accepted these items gratefully."
0870-2,"No, the man did not give his belongings to the photographer out of simple kindness.

**Explanation:** The man and child appear to be in distress and poverty, sheltering from the rain. The photographer points at the man's makeshift shelter (cardboard) and begging hat. The man's actions in response (putting down the cardboard, using the hat) seem driven by compliance, his difficult circumstances, and potentially the hope of receiving aid, rather than a voluntary act of kindness towards the photographer. His distressed expression further suggests the interaction is not a simple, willing gesture of giving."
0871-3,"No, the person is not holding two bags. They pick up a single pink, flat, circular object from the middle of the road."
0871-2,"No, the image is not a standard chalk drawing. It appears to be an optical illusion, likely created using anamorphic techniques or a digital visual effect. The way the figure stretches and distorts significantly as the viewpoint changes indicates it's designed to look correct only from a specific perspective, which is characteristic of an anamorphic illusion rather than a simple, flat chalk drawing."
0871-1,"A person, likely a child, is in the center of the road. They are wearing a light blue top, blue shorts/pants, and white shoes, and are picking up a bright pink circular disc, possibly a frisbee."
0871-0,"A person holding a bright pink object is in the middle of the road. The video shows an individual bending down to pick up this pink item in the center of the roadway, just beyond a crosswalk."
0871-7,D
0872-1,"The top water bottle pack was not moved after being placed down. The young man placed both packs and left, and the elderly man later only removed individual bottles from the top pack without shifting the pack itself."
0872-3,"**No.** After placing the second (upper/left) pack of water bottles down, the younger man nudges the first pack (the one on the right) slightly to the left. The upper pack itself is not moved after being placed."
0872-2,"No. After placing the two packs of water bottles side-by-side on the ground (with the right pack slightly forward), the younger man immediately stands up and walks away without touching or repositioning either pack."
0872-0,The upper pack was not moved after being placed down. Both packs of water bottles remained stationary on the ground after the man set them down and walked away.

0875-1,"There is **one** cell phone placed on the piano.

It is positioned vertically on the left side, immediately next to the keyboard."
0875-0,"**One:** There is one cell phone visible, mounted on a stand or charger attached to the left side of the piano, near the keys."
0875-3,"Yes, there is only one cell phone visible on the piano, and it is positioned upright on the far left side, to the left of where the pianist is playing."
0875-2,"**No.** There is only one cell phone clearly placed *on* the piano, which has a light-colored case and is situated near the lower keys on the left side. Another phone with a green case is visible near the higher keys on the right, but it is being held by a person standing next to the piano, not resting on the instrument itself."
0875-7,D
0879-1,"Starting from the fourth second, the change in perspective reveals that the figures are not actually on the same continuous plane.

**Explanation:** The new viewpoint breaks the optical illusion, showing that the structure is composed of three separate, disconnected beams. Each figure is standing on the end of one of these distinct segments, demonstrating they occupy spatially separated positions that only appeared connected from the initial angle."
0879-0,"After the fourth second, the camera rotation reveals that the figures are **not** standing on the same plane.

**Explanation:** The rotation breaks the optical illusion. It shows that the object is composed of separate segments positioned at different depths and angles in 3D space. Each figure is located on a distinct, unconnected segment, proving they do not share a single plane."
0879-2,"Yes.

Based on the optical illusion presented by the Penrose triangle from this specific viewpoint, the figure with the white head/shirt (top left) and the figure with the black outfit (bottom left) appear to be standing on the same continuous plane or surface along the left edge of the structure."
0879-7,A
0879-3,"No, they are not on the same plane. The figure in blue is on the top-right segment of the Penrose triangle, while the figure with the white head is on the top-left segment. The Penrose triangle is an optical illusion where surfaces appear connected due to perspective, but the figures occupy distinct faces of the object."
0886-3,"Yes. The video clearly shows the man's watch on his left wrist, especially as his left arm is prominently visible when he raises his arms during the demonstration."
0886-1,"**Left wrist:** The watch is clearly visible on the man's left wrist throughout the video, particularly when he raises his arms at the beginning (0:00-0:02) and while handling the tube (e.g., 0:06, 0:11, 0:17)."
0886-0,"Left wrist.
Explanation: The watch is visible on the man's left wrist when he raises his arms to drop the cans into the tube and again when he lifts and inverts the tube filled with water."
0886-2,"No, the watch is not worn on the right wrist. It is clearly visible on the man's left wrist throughout the video."
0886-7,C
0880-2,"Yes, the structure would likely lose its directional illusion when held up towards the camera.

This type of illusion is highly dependent on the specific viewing angle from which it is observed. Lifting the object changes the perspective, revealing the true, more complex 3D shape of the object, which breaks the illusion that it consistently points in one direction."
0880-1,"When the structure is lifted by hand and rotated 180 degrees, its perceived direction remains unchanged; it consistently appears to point to the right from the camera's viewpoint. This is an optical illusion caused by the specific 3D shape of the arrow, which makes it look like it's pointing right regardless of this rotation when viewed from this angle."
0880-3,"Yes, the structure *appears* to change direction relative to its reflection because of the mirror.

**Explanation:**
The physical act of lifting and rotating the arrow by 180 degrees changes its actual direction (e.g., from pointing right to pointing left). A plane mirror creates a laterally inverted image, meaning it reverses the image along the axis perpendicular to the mirror, which appears as a left-right swap for horizontally oriented objects like this arrow. Therefore, when the rotated arrow (pointing left) is viewed in the mirror, its reflection points right. This difference between the object's direction and its reflection's direction is the apparent change caused by the interaction with the mirror."
0880-0,"When the mirror is held up by the hand, the reflection of the arrow structure points in the opposite horizontal direction (left) compared to the actual arrow (which points right).

This change in apparent direction occurs because a plane mirror creates a laterally inverted image, reversing the image left-to-right relative to the object."
0880-7,A
0895-3,"Yes. After the shot into the spiked hoop, the video cuts to a scene where a person shoots a basketball into a mini hoop attached to a wooden pole."
0895-1,"Following the successful shot into the mini hoop, the video transitions to a scene featuring a basketball hoop modified with a chainsaw chain acting as the rim. The text ""chainsaw rim"" appears on screen, and a man is shown successfully making a shot into this hazardous-looking hoop."
0895-2,"Yes, after the scene showing the successful shot into the mini hoop (which concludes around 0:06-0:07), the video immediately cuts to the scene starting at 0:07 featuring the chainsaw rim hoop, with that shot going in around 0:09."
0895-7,D
0895-0,"The scene shows a basketball hoop modified with a chainsaw chain rim, labeled ""chainsaw rim"".

**Explanation:** After the successful shot into the ""mini hoop"", the video transitions to an outdoor setting featuring a basketball hoop where the standard rim has been replaced by a chainsaw chain. A basketball is then successfully shot through this modified hoop."
0898-3,"No. After throwing the first pillow onto the water vortex, the man did not move it again. He immediately threw a second pillow and stepped onto that one instead."
0898-1,"Once the man placed the first pillow on the water effect, he did not move it again until later when he stepped on it. The pillow itself immediately began to float and was carried by the swirling motion of the digital vortex effect, rotating and moving in a circular path towards the center."
0898-7,C
0898-0,"Towards the sofa.

The man pushed off the first pillow with his hands to propel himself forward (towards the center of the vortex), causing the first pillow to move in the opposite direction, which was back towards the sofa."
0898-2,"No, the man did not move the first pillow after throwing it onto the water effect. He threw the first pillow, then placed a second pillow, and jumped onto the first pillow in the location where it originally landed."
0905-0,"At the beginning of the video, the slope where the ball is located appears to be **uphill**.

This is because the specific camera angle and the design of the object create an optical illusion, making the ramp look like it ascends towards the center, even though it physically slopes downwards (as revealed later)."
0905-2,"Yes, the slope where the ball is located at the beginning of the video is actually a downhill slope.

**Explanation:** Although the camera angle creates an optical illusion making the ramp appear to slope upwards towards the center, the physical structure, as revealed later in the video when the object is rotated, shows that all four ramps actually slope downwards towards the central point. The marble rolls towards the center because it is following gravity down the true incline."
0905-1,"**Appears Upward (Incline):** The marble is positioned on what appears to be an incline. This is because, due to the optical illusion created by the camera angle and the object's design, the ramp seems to slope upwards towards the center of the structure, even though the marble actually rolls downhill towards the physically lower central point."
0905-3,"Yes, from the initial camera perspective shown at the beginning of the video, the ramp where the marble is placed appears to slope upward towards the center of the object. This perception is a deliberate optical illusion created by the specific camera angle and the object's geometry; the ramp actually slopes downward."
0905-7,B
0901-1,"**Answer:** One

**Explanation:** At the beginning of the video, the person is holding a single green rubber band stretched between the thumb and index finger of both hands."
0901-0,"1

**Explanation:**
At the very beginning of the video (00:00), the person is holding a single green rubber band stretched between the index finger and thumb of both hands."
0901-3,Yes. The video begins with the person holding a single green rubber band stretched between the thumb and index finger of both hands.
0901-2,"No, the hand is not holding two rubber bands at the beginning of the video.

Although it visually appears as if there are two rubber bands stretched between the thumbs and index fingers of both hands at the start of the trick demonstration (0:00), this is an illusion created by twisting a single rubber band. The subsequent steps shown in the video reveal how this illusion is set up and undone using only one band."
0901-7,C
0907-0,"The dog lands on the grass.

**Explanation:** After the man jumps on one end of the makeshift seesaw, the dog is launched off the other end and lands directly onto the grassy lawn in the backyard."
0907-2,"No, the dog does not land on the man's body. The seesaw action launches the dog forward onto the grass, while the man falls backward in a different spot. They land separately with a noticeable distance between them."
0907-3,"No, the dog does not land on the grass *at the end of the video*. The clip concludes while the dog is still airborne and descending, cutting off before the actual landing occurs."
0907-1,"The dog lands on the grass in the backyard.

It is launched into the air by the seesaw mechanism created by the man and lands several feet away on the lawn, tumbling over once upon impact before getting back up."

0910-1,None
0910-3,"No. The man's actions show him picking up the child and moving away from the street towards a building entrance, indicating his purpose was not to cross the street."
0910-2,"No, there is no indication within the video that the man is picking up the child as part of a social experiment. The interaction appears playful and consensual, with the child laughing and seemingly enjoying being picked up repeatedly. The man's demeanor seems relaxed and affectionate, consistent with a guardian playing with a child, and bystanders do not show signs of alarm."
0910-7,C
0914-2,"Yes, the beer bottle is placed under the faucet to show how hot water can shrink the plastic packaging around it. The video clearly demonstrates a loose black plastic sleeve being placed over the bottle, and when hot water from the faucet runs over it, the sleeve visibly contracts and conforms tightly to the shape of the bottle."
0914-1,"The purpose of placing the beer bottle under the hot water faucet is to apply a heat-shrink sleeve label.

**Explanation:** The bottle initially has a loose plastic sleeve placed over it. The hot water provides the heat necessary to cause this sleeve material to shrink rapidly and conform tightly to the contours of the bottle. Rotating the bottle under the stream ensures that the heat is applied evenly across the entire surface of the sleeve, resulting in a smooth, tightly fitted label without wrinkles or distortion. This is a method for applying full-body branding or decoration to the bottle."
0914-7,A
0914-3,"No, the beer bottle is not placed under the faucet for cooling. The faucet is clearly labeled ""Hot Water"" in both English and Chinese, indicating the water used is hot, which would warm the bottle rather than cool it."
0914-0,"The beer bottle is placed under the hot water faucet to heat the plastic shrink sleeve label. The heat causes the sleeve to shrink rapidly and detach from the glass, making it easy to remove cleanly."
0918-7,D
0918-2,Yes. The video shows that he uses his right hand to pick up individual soap strips and then places them into the jar held by his left hand.
0918-0,**Right hand** (Explanation: The video at 0:06-0:07 shows the man holding the jar steady with his left hand while using his right hand to pick up the individual blue soap shavings from the rock and place them into the jar.)
0918-1,The man places the soap shavings into the box (jar) using his **right hand**. He holds the jar steady with his left hand while using his right hand to pick up the individual soap shavings and deposit them inside.
0918-3,No. The man holds the jar with his left hand and uses his right hand to put the soap shavings into the jar.
0919-0,"The man creates the rainbow by first coloring the outer surface of a clear tape roll with different colored markers, drawing stripes in rainbow order (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple). He then takes this colored tape roll and his phone into a dark room. By turning on the phone's flashlight and placing the colored tape roll over it so the light shines upwards through the center, the marker ink acts as a color filter. The light passing through each colored stripe is projected onto the wall as beams of colored light, creating the rainbow effect."
0919-3,"No. The man creates the rainbow effect by coloring sections of clear tape with markers in the colors of the rainbow. He then shines a light from his smartphone flashlight through the colored tape, which acts as a filter, projecting the colored stripes onto the wall. This is different from using a prism, which refracts white light and separates it into its constituent colors based on wavelength."
0919-2,"Yes. The video shows the man coloring stripes onto the outer (non-adhesive) side of a roll of clear tape with markers. He then takes the tape roll and his phone into a dark room, turns on the phone's flashlight, and holds the colored tape roll over the light, projecting rainbow-colored beams onto the wall."
0919-7,C
0919-1,"The man creates a rainbow effect using a simple projection method.

He colors horizontal stripes onto a piece of clear tape using multiple colored markers. He then sticks this colored section of tape across the central hole of the tape roll. By shining a smartphone flashlight through this colored tape in a dark room, the light passes through the different colored marker stripes, projecting beams of colored light onto a surface, resembling a rainbow."
0924-3,"No, the woman in the white top is not holding a red bottle at the end of the video. She is shown running away with empty hands after being splashed with blue liquid."
0924-0,"The red object in the hand of the woman in the white top is a book. When she is splashed with the blue liquid, she drops the book onto the paved ground next to her chair."
0924-1,"The red item associated with the woman in the white top is a book. At the video's conclusion, the book is lying on the ground next to her chair; she apparently dropped it in shock when she was splashed with the blue liquid."
0924-2,"No, the woman in the white top is not holding the red book at the end of the video. She dropped the book on the ground when she was splashed with the blue liquid."
0924-7,B
0926-2,"No, the right hand is not responsible for pulling the thread through the needle. Instead, the right hand facilitates the process by rubbing the needle's eye back and forth against the taut thread. This rubbing action creates friction and micro-vibrations, which help guide the thread through the eye of the needle."
0926-3,"No, the left hand is not responsible for pulling the thread through the needle. Its primary role is to hold the thread taut and stable across the palm, providing the necessary tension and stationary base for the friction method used by the right hand to guide the thread into the needle's eye."
0926-1,"The right hand is used to move the needle. However, neither hand actively pulls the thread through the needle's eye; the thread enters the eye passively due to the friction and vibration created by rubbing the needle's eye back and forth across the taut thread."
0926-0,The left hand is holding the thread taut across the palm. It maintains the tension required for the right hand to rub the needle's eye across it.
0926-7,A
0927-1,"**Right arm:** The man uses his right arm to hold the child, wrapping it around the baby's back and under their bottom for support."
0927-0,"The man holds the child with his **left arm**.

His left arm is wrapped around the baby's back and bottom, supporting the child against his body, while his right hand is holding and eating the popsicle."
0927-3,"Yes, the man uses his right arm to securely support the baby by wrapping it around the child's back and side, while his left hand holds a red/pink popsicle."
0927-7,C
0927-2,"No, the man is holding the child with his right arm and holding the popsicle with his left hand."
0929-1,"Both the little girl in the green dress and the little girl in the blue dress behave similarly towards the statue in several key ways:

1.  **Curious Approach and Tentative Touch:** Both girls approach the living statue with curiosity and then tentatively reach out to touch it, suggesting they initially perceive it as an inanimate object.
2.  **Startled Reaction to Movement:** When the statue makes a subtle, unexpected movement after being touched, both girls react instantly with surprise.
3.  **Physical Recoil and Retreat:** Both girls physically jump or recoil sharply away from the statue immediately after being startled. They then quickly retreat towards nearby adults.
4.  **Nervous Laughter and Seeking Comfort:** Following the initial shock, both girls exhibit nervous laughter and seek comfort or reassurance from the adults they run to.

In essence, both girls follow a similar pattern: curiosity leads to testing reality with a touch, followed by surprise and fear when the ""statue"" shows signs of life, culminating in retreat and seeking safety with caregivers, mixed with amusement at the scare."
0929-2,"No, neither the little girl in the green dress nor the little girl in the blue dress tried to support the statue when it moved. Both children were startled by the statue's sudden movement and reacted by immediately running away from it."
0929-0,"Both the little girl in the green dress and the little girl in the blue dress exhibit similar reactions to the living statue performer:

1.  **Initial Approach:** Both girls curiously approach the performer, getting very close.
2.  **Startled Reaction:** When the performer unexpectedly turns his head towards them, both girls are visibly startled and jump back.
3.  **Immediate Retreat:** Following the startle, both girls quickly run away from the performer.
4.  **Seeking Comfort:** Both girls run directly towards an adult (presumably a parent or guardian) for comfort, ending the interaction with a hug.
5.  **Nervous Laughter/Amusement:** As they retreat, both girls display nervous laughter, indicating a mixture of surprise, fear, and amusement at the unexpected movement."
0929-3,"Yes, the little girls appear to be trying to determine if the statue is real.

**Explanation:** Both girls approach the statue cautiously and interact with it physically. The girl in the green dress touches the statue's leg and waves her hand near its face, while the girl in the blue dress also reaches out to touch it. Their startled reactions, jumping back, and running away laughing when the performer moves slightly indicate they were testing the ""statue"" and were surprised to find it was a real person."
0929-7,D
0939-0,"One person.

Explanation: The same individual portrayed all the characters shown in the video, including the three boys and the dad."
0939-1,"There is **one** individual acting in the video. This single actor portrays all the characters (the three friends and the dad) through changes in clothing, positioning, and editing techniques to create the illusion of multiple people."
0939-3,"No, there are not four different people playing roles in the video. It is the same actor portraying all the characters, including the dad and the three boys."
0939-2,"Yes, it is true that only one person played all the roles in the video.

**Explanation:** All the characters depicted—the three boys and the dad—share identical facial features, hair, glasses, and general build. The video uses editing cuts to transition between scenes, allowing the single actor time to change clothes and position to portray the different characters sequentially, rather than showing them interacting simultaneously in a way that would require multiple actors."
0939-7,B
0933-1,"The video does not show the man in the costume starting a fire. Instead, it shows the mascot surprising a woman working on a laptop by hitting her in the face with cream or a pie. The reason for this action appears to be a prank or practical joke, intended for comedic effect and to surprise the woman."
0933-2,"No, the man in the costume did not light a fire. The video shows the mascot approaching the woman, making a sound, and then hitting her with a pie; no fire or flame was used as part of the prank."
0933-0,"The man in the costume did not light a fire. He hit the woman with a pie tin filled with cream.

This action was intended as a prank or practical joke, done for comedic effect and to surprise the woman while she was focused on her work."
0933-3,"No, the person in the mascot costume did not light any fire. The video shows the mascot sneaking up on the woman and smashing a pie tin filled with white cream into her face as a prank. There are no visual or auditory indications of fire or flames being used; the surprise was solely the pie attack."
0933-7,E
0942-0,"The purpose of the man catching the egg on the spatula and breaking it with another spatula is primarily for **precision, control, and showmanship, enabling subsequent egg art.**

**Explanation:** This technique allows the man to:
1.  **Precisely place** the egg exactly where he wants it on the hot surface.
2.  Achieve a **clean crack** using the edge of the second spatula, minimizing shell fragments and controlling the break.
3.  Immediately **control the flow** of the egg white to draw the heart shape and characters, which is the next step shown.
4.  **Demonstrate skill and flair**, adding an element of performance common in teppanyaki cooking."
0942-3,"No, the man is not breaking the egg simply to show how fragile it is. He is demonstrating his advanced teppanyaki skills, precision, and artistry by skillfully cracking the egg with a spatula and then using the egg white to draw on the hot surface. The focus is on his technique and control, not the inherent fragility of the egg."
0942-7,C
0942-1,"The man uses the flat side of the spatula to catch the egg because it provides a larger, stable surface area, distributing the impact and preventing the fragile shell from breaking prematurely upon landing.

He then uses the sharp edge of the spatula to break the egg because it allows for a quick, clean, and precise crack. This controlled break is essential for immediately guiding the flow of the egg white and yolk onto the hot grill to create the intended artistic design (the heart shape and writing). The combination showcases skill, control, and efficiency, common elements in teppanyaki performance."
0942-2,"Yes, the man is demonstrating a teppanyaki cooking technique. He skillfully tosses an egg with one spatula and catches it on the edge of another, breaking it onto the hot grill surface. He then proceeds to manipulate the egg into a design."
0949-2,"Yes, the boss appears at the start as a beggar and later in a suit.

**Explanation:**
The video begins with a man disguised as a blind beggar sitting on the street. Later, during a job interview scene, this same man enters the room dressed in a suit and is identified as the boss. The narrative reveals that his time as a beggar was a test for the job applicants."
0949-3,"No, the boss does not only appear at the end of the video in a suit. He is also present earlier in the video, disguised as a blind/homeless person sitting on the street, to test the character of the job candidates before revealing his true identity during the interview phase."
0949-0,"The boss appears in two capacities:

1.  **0:00 - 0:34:** He is disguised as a blind beggar sitting on the street, testing the character of passersby as part of a hidden interview process.
2.  **0:53 - 0:59:** He appears as himself, the company owner, entering the interview room to reveal that the beggar was him and that the real test occurred earlier on the street."
0949-1,"The company's boss appears in the following scenes:

1.  **0:00 - 0:34:** The boss is disguised as a blind beggar sitting on the sidewalk. During this time, he interacts with a woman who steals his money, a man in a suit who also steals from him and kicks him, and finally, a kind young man who returns the money he sees under the box and gives him some change.
2.  **0:53 - 0:59:** The boss enters the office where the job interview is taking place, no longer disguised. He reveals his identity to the candidates, explaining that the interview process started earlier on the street. He then returns the money to the kind young man who had helped him."

0946-0,"The man did not touch either of the chicken's feet after it stopped moving. He held the chicken's head/neck area down near the line drawn on the ground, and once the chicken became still, he removed his hands without touching its feet."
0946-1,"Based on the video, the man did not touch the chicken's foot when inducing the state of stillness. The process involved restraining the chicken's body, holding its head down against the ground, and drawing a line in the dirt starting from its beak."
0946-7,B
0946-3,"No, the man did not touch the chicken's right foot after it stopped moving. The interactions shown in the video involve one person holding the chicken's head/upper body and another drawing/erasing the line near its head; there is no visual evidence of contact with the chicken's right foot during that specific time frame."
0946-2,"No, the man did not touch the chicken's left foot after it stopped moving. The video shows the man releasing the chicken, which then remains stationary and fixated on the line without any further physical contact from the man during that period."
0950-7,D
0950-1,"The ping pong ball bounces rapidly against the first tuning fork.

**Explanation:** When the man hits the second tuning fork (which is now also 260 Hz, matching the first), it vibrates and sends sound waves through the air. Because both tuning forks have the same natural frequency (260 Hz), the sound waves from the second fork cause the first fork to vibrate strongly. This phenomenon is called sympathetic resonance. The vibration of the first fork makes it repeatedly hit the nearby ping pong ball, causing the ball to bounce."
0950-2,"Yes, the ball remains still.

This happens because the second tuning fork struck has a frequency of 240 Hz, while the tuning fork next to the ball has a natural frequency of 260 Hz. Since the frequencies do not match, resonance does not occur, and significant vibrational energy is not transferred to the fork near the ball, leaving the ball undisturbed."
0950-3,"No, the ball does not start moving upwards (or bounce).

This is because the second tuning fork struck has a frequency of 240 Hz, while the tuning fork next to the ball has a natural frequency of 260 Hz. For the sound waves from the struck fork to cause the other fork to vibrate strongly enough to move the ball (a phenomenon called resonance), their frequencies must match very closely. Since 240 Hz does not match 260 Hz, resonance does not occur, and the first fork does not vibrate significantly enough to affect the ping pong ball."
0950-0,"The ping pong ball remains still.

**Explanation:**
When the man strikes the second tuning fork (240 Hz), its frequency does not match the natural frequency of the first tuning fork (260 Hz) next to the ball. Because the frequencies are different, resonance does not occur, and the vibrations from the 240 Hz fork are not effectively transferred to the 260 Hz fork. Therefore, the 260 Hz fork does not vibrate with enough amplitude to move the ping pong ball."
0952-2,"Yes, the adult skier helping the child is wearing an outfit that includes both orange and black. Their jacket features orange on the upper part and black on the lower part and arms, and they are also wearing black pants and a black helmet."
0952-3,"No, the third person in the video, the adult skier, is wearing an orange/red jacket and black pants. The child is the one wearing the pink outfit."
0952-0,The third person clearly visible in the video is the adult skier. They are wearing an orange or reddish-orange jacket.
0952-1,"The third individual, an adult skier, is wearing an orange/red-orange jacket and black pants."
0952-7,C
0956-0,"**Counter-clockwise.**

Explanation: When viewed from above (starting around 0:02 in the video), the right red end of the stick moves towards the bottom of the screen, and the left red end moves towards the top, indicating a counter-clockwise rotation around its pivot point."
0956-2,"No, the red stick rotates in a counter-clockwise direction relative to the camera."
0956-1,"The red stick rotates counter-clockwise.

**Explanation:** When viewed from the top-down perspective starting around the 0:02 mark, the push applied causes the red end to move towards the top of the frame and then swing left, indicating a counter-clockwise rotation."
0956-3,"**Yes**, the red stick rotates in a counterclockwise direction relative to the camera.

**Explanation:** Observing the rod from the top-down camera view, the red end initially positioned towards the lower right moves upwards and towards the left around the central pivot point, indicating a counterclockwise rotation."
0956-7,C
0957-0,"The nylon string, formed at the interface between the two immiscible liquids in the beaker, was grasped using tweezers. The tweezers were then used to pull the string upwards and wrap it onto the glass rod held above the beaker. Continuous pulling allowed more nylon to form and be wound onto the rod."
0957-2,"Yes. The video shows tweezers being used to pull a white, stringy substance from the interface between the two liquids in the beaker. This substance is then continuously wound onto a glass rod held above the beaker."
0957-1,"The substance, nylon polymer, formed as a film at the interface between the two immiscible liquid layers in the beaker. A pair of tweezers was used to grasp this film and pull it upwards, drawing out a continuous strand. This strand was then attached to a glass rod, and the nylon was wound onto the rod by rotating it, which continuously pulled more of the newly forming polymer strand from the interface."
0957-7,D
0957-3,"No. The substance (nylon) accumulated on the glass rod because tweezers were used to continuously pull the newly formed nylon strand from the interface between the two liquids and actively wind it onto the rod. The rod served as a collection spool, but the accumulation was driven by the mechanical action of pulling and winding with the tweezers, not by simple adhesion when the rod was inserted."
0973-2,"Yes, the man in the gray hoodie on the left (MrBeast) got injured.

**Explanation:** During the final stage of the game, which involved throwing small objects at large balloon clusters, MrBeast was struck on the forehead by one of the thrown projectiles. He reacted in pain, and the video subsequently shows a visible, bleeding cut on his forehead."
0973-1,"**0:48-0:51:** Explanation: The injury likely occurred slightly before this during the final throwing segment (around 0:41-0:47) when projectiles were bouncing back, causing MrBeast to react. However, the injury is first clearly visible and acknowledged starting at 0:48 as he turns to the camera after the throwing stops, with the clearest views and close-up occurring between 0:49 and 0:51."
0973-0,"The man in the gray hoodie (MrBeast) got injured at **0:41**. This is the moment during the final stage where he throws an object, immediately flinches, and exclaims ""Ow!"", indicating he was struck by a ricocheting object."
0973-3,"No, the man in the gray hoodie on the left (MrBeast) did not get injured at the beginning of the video. The injury occurred much later, during the final segment where participants were throwing objects at balloon clusters. He was hit on the forehead by one of the thrown objects, causing a cut."

0974-0,"**Timestamp:** 00:03 - 00:04

**Explanation:** During this one-second interval, the video clearly shows the orange straw being inserted into the hole on the side of the plastic bottle while hot glue is simultaneously applied around the entry point to seal it."
0974-7,D
0974-2,"Yes. The video first shows the preparation steps, which include emptying the bottle and inserting an orange straw into its side, before the scene shifts to the public location where the trick is performed."
0974-3,"No, the person did not put the straw into the bottle while sitting at the table. The video shows the straw being inserted into the bottle and sealed with hot glue during the preparation phase at the beginning, before the scene at the table."
0974-1,"At **00:02**, the person begins inserting the orange straw into the top opening of the empty plastic bottle."
0976-0,"The woman answers the question correctly first.

**Explanation:** In the first scene (0:00-0:03), the man guesses ""Roads."" Immediately after, the woman guesses ""Crossroads,"" which is shown as the correct answer, and the score updates to 0-1 in her favor."
0976-1,"**Answer:** The man on the left speaks first.

**Explanation:** Immediately after the question ""What is this?"" appears on screen, the man on the left offers the first guess, saying ""Roads""."
0976-2,"Yes, the man on the left responds before the woman on the right.

At the 0:01 mark, after the puzzle ""ROADS ROADS"" appears, the man on the left says ""Roads"". Immediately after, at the 0:02 mark, the woman on the right says the correct answer, ""Crossroads""."
0976-7,D
0976-3,"No, the person on the right was not the first to answer. The man on the left spoke first, guessing ""Roads""."
0983-7,A
0983-3,"No, the second person in the video is not the painted silhouette of a girl. The second person is the security guard, who is a live actor interacting with the scene and the artist. The silhouette of the girl is part of the artwork being painted on the wall."
0983-0,"The appearance of the second person, a security guard, serves several key functions in the video:

1.  **To Create Conflict and Narrative:** The security guard's chase introduces conflict, motivating the artist's actions and creating a reason for the ""escape.""
2.  **To Highlight the Illusion:** By attempting to climb the painted ladder and failing, the guard demonstrates and confirms that the ladder is merely a clever painting (trompe-l'œil), showcasing the artwork's effectiveness.
3.  **To Provide Comedic Effect:** The guard's futile attempt to climb the flat painting serves as the punchline to the visual gag, adding humor to the scene.
4.  **To Act as a Foil:** His inability to use the painted ladder contrasts sharply with the artist's seemingly successful ""escape"" via the same painting, emphasizing the blend of art and reality within the video's concept."
0983-1,"The appearance of the second individual, a security guard, is caused by him observing the first individual actively spray painting a mural onto the wall. The security guard intervenes because he witnesses this act of painting on the property."
0983-2,"Yes, the second person in the video is a security guard investigating the graffiti artist.

This is confirmed by the word ""SECURITY"" clearly visible on the back of his jacket, his verbal confrontation (""Hey you! You can't be doing that!""), and his action of chasing the artist."
0995-0,"**Answer:** Long overdue

**Explanation:** The puzzle displays the word ""long"" positioned directly *over* the word ""due"", separated by a line. This visual arrangement represents the common phrase ""long overdue""."
0995-1,"The response to the eighth question (""long / due"") was **""Long overdue""**. Both contestants answered simultaneously, leading to a rock-paper-scissors tiebreaker to award the point."
0995-2,"Yes.

**Explanation:** The eighth puzzle visually shows the word ""long"" positioned above the word ""due"", separated by a line. This represents the phrase ""long overdue"". Both participants in the video correctly identify this answer."
0995-7,D
0995-3,"No, the answer to the eighth question in the video is not 'up to no good'.

**Explanation:**

The eighth puzzle shown in the video (at 0:56) displays the word ""long"" positioned above the word ""due"". Both participants correctly identify the answer as ""Long overdue"". The puzzle answered as ""Up to no good"" (featuring the number 2 above a crossed-out ""GOOD"") was the fifth puzzle presented (at 0:21)."
0985-1,"No, the money is not the same.

**Explanation:** The man initially places a banknote under the cup. However, the woman then takes that banknote from under the cup before the man lifts it the final time, revealing an empty space where the original banknote used to be."
0985-3,"No, the money did not stay in the cup. The cup was placed *over* the banknote on the table each time; the banknote was never actually inside the cup."
0985-2,"No. The money did not come from the man's ear. The video clearly shows the rolled-up money already placed on the table at the very beginning, before the man covers it with the cup."
0985-0,"Yes, the money revealed at the end is the same money placed under the cup at the beginning.
Explanation: The video shows the woman subtly reaching under the cup and taking the banknote while the man is performing the cup movements. When he lifts the cup later, the money is gone, and she then reveals the banknote she took."
0985-7,C
0996-3,"No, the third timekeeping tool shown in the video is not a sundial. The character Mobohmad describes his concept as using a ""pendulum swing mechanism"" to create constant movement in what he calls ""hands."" This describes the principle of a mechanical clock, whereas a sundial uses the sun's shadow cast by a gnomon to indicate the time."
0996-2,"No, the third timekeeping tool shown is not a clock that uses a pendulum swing mechanism. While the character describes a concept involving a pendulum, the object he holds is merely a static paper prop representing a clock face and lacks any actual mechanical parts or a functioning pendulum."
0996-1,"The third timekeeping device featured is the white paper circle with two black hands.

This represents a conceptual mechanical clock, presented by the second inventor (""Mobohmad""), who explains it would use a ""pendulum swing mechanism"" to create constant movement in what he calls ""hands"" to tell time."
0996-0,"The third timer tool shown is the concept for a **mechanical clock**.

It is presented by the character named Mobohmad, who describes using a ""pendulum swing mechanism"" to move ""hands"" on a circular face. He holds a white circular cutout with two black lines representing these hands."
0996-7,B
0999-2,"No, the man playing Curly does not trip while walking backwards.

**Explanation:**
He trips over the branch while walking *forwards* along the path, which causes him to fall backward comically."
0999-1,"While portraying Curly and making ""woo woo woo"" sounds, the man trips over the branch, falls onto his back, spins around on the ground, gets onto his hands and knees, and then makes barking sounds."
0999-0,"The man approaches the branch making Curly's signature ""woo-woo-woo"" sounds. He then trips over the branch, falls backward onto the ground, gets up onto his hands and knees, and makes barking sounds."
0999-3,"No, the man playing Curly trips over the branches and falls, but he only gets onto his hands and knees to continue moving forward; he does not get fully back up to a standing position."
0999-7,A
1002-1,"He catches the stick by holding the two black cylindrical catchers horizontally, one slightly above the other, and quickly bringing them together to clamp or trap the falling stick between them as it passes through the gap."
1002-3,"**No**

**Explanation:** In the first scene, the man attempts to catch the fourth falling stick with the baton held in his *left* hand, but he misses, and the stick falls to the ground. His right hand was not used for that specific catch attempt."
1002-0,"The video clip cuts away before the fourth stick falls. Therefore, the man's action of catching or attempting to catch the fourth stick is not shown in this segment."
1002-2,"Yes. After missing the fourth falling stick with the baton held in his hand, the man lifts his right foot off the ground and moves it towards the stick in an apparent attempt to stop or kick it."
1002-7,D
1009-3,"Yes, the man appears enthusiastic and eager to engage with the visitors in the first two scenes. His proactive approach, combined with specific comments about the artwork (such as the artist's age and the amount of paint used), indicates a genuine interest in discussing the art itself rather than just offering a generic greeting."
1009-0,"The man reacts with polite acceptance in both scenes after the visitors indicate they don't wish to talk.

**Explanation:** Although he seems eager to share information about the art, when politely turned down (""I'm just looking thank you,"" ""Oh I'm ok thank you""), he smiles, nods respectfully, and steps back slightly without showing frustration or pressing the conversation further. He maintains a professional and courteous demeanor despite his initial enthusiasm being unmet."
1009-7,D
1009-2,"No, he does not seem disappointed and does not walk away. In both scenes, after the visitor politely declines further conversation, the man smiles, nods, and remains nearby. Additionally, the visitors do not wave at him in these scenes; they respond verbally."
1009-1,"In the first two scenes, after the visitors politely decline his attempts to discuss the art, the man reacts with quiet acceptance. His smile fades noticeably, he stops his commentary mid-sentence, looks down briefly, and appears slightly deflated or discouraged, respecting their wish to look independently without pressing the conversation further."
1023-2,"No, the man did not show clear signs of frustration or disappointment. He responded with a polite smile and nod, maintaining professional composure and accepting her response gracefully without displaying negative non-verbal cues."
1023-1,"He lowered his pointing hand and briefly looked down towards the floor. This happened right after the woman said, ""I'm just looking thank you,"" acknowledging her response and disengaging from the conversation attempt."
1023-3,"No. After the first woman replied, ""I'm just looking thank you,"" the man's initial enthusiasm seemed to fade; his smile lessened, and his body language appeared slightly deflated or disappointed rather than happy or excited."
1023-7,A
1023-0,"After the first woman politely declines his attempt to engage (""I'm just looking thank you""), the man's reaction is one of mild disappointment and acceptance. He immediately stops gesturing towards the painting, his enthusiastic smile fades significantly, he places his hands on his hips, and briefly looks down, signaling a pause in his attempt to discuss the art."
1018-2,"Yes, the rapper calmly took the microphone back from the traffic controller and immediately resumed his performance without any visible signs of distress, appearing unfazed by the interruption."
1018-1,"The rapper responded calmly and cooperatively when the traffic controller took his microphone.

He paused his performance, allowed the traffic controller to take the microphone without resistance, and listened patiently while the controller made a safety announcement telling people to get out of the street. The rapper remained composed, showed no anger or frustration, and accepted the microphone back when the controller finished speaking."
1018-0,"The rapper steps back slightly and smiles, appearing amused and surprised by the traffic controller taking the microphone to make a safety announcement."
1018-7,B
1018-3,"No, the rapper did not get angry or stop performing when the traffic controller took his microphone. He remained calm and composed during the interruption, pausing his performance only temporarily while the traffic controller made a safety announcement. The rapper cooperated, waited patiently, and smoothly resumed rapping as soon as the microphone was handed back to him."
1011-0,"The woman used the hose on the man because she genuinely believed he had just bitten into a real kitchen sponge.

**Explanation:** The man executed a prank where he made a Rice Krispie treat look identical to the blue sponge she was using. When he pretended to bite the ""sponge,"" her shocked reaction (""Oh my god!"") and immediate use of the spray hose indicate she panicked, thinking he was eating something inedible and potentially harmful (like soap residue). Spraying him was an impulsive, startled attempt to make him stop or spit it out."
1011-1,"The man put a blue object that looked exactly like a kitchen sponge into his mouth and bit down on it. The woman, shocked by the act of him seemingly eating a cleaning sponge, immediately sprayed him with the sink hose."
1011-3,Yes. The woman sprayed the man with the sink's pull-down sprayer immediately after he startled her by pretending to eat what looked like a sponge (which was actually a disguised treat). Her spraying him was a direct reaction to his prank.
1011-7,D
1011-2,"Yes, the woman used the hose on the man because her shocked reaction (""Oh my god!"") immediately after he bit the object indicates she believed he was biting the actual dish sponge, which could contain soap or be dirty."
1020-0,"What's the baby's reaction when they see dad?
Please state your answer with a brief explanation.

The baby looks at the father attentively with a neutral, wide-eyed expression. The baby remains quiet and relatively still, observing the father without smiling or reaching out."
1020-3,"The baby's reaction is more neutral.
**Explanation:** When the dad says ""Hi,"" the baby looks at him with a relatively neutral, perhaps slightly curious, expression but doesn't show overt signs of excitement like smiling broadly, reaching out, or vocalizing happily, especially when compared to the interactions with the mom and brother."
1020-2,"Yes. The baby looks at the dad with a neutral, wide-eyed expression, showing less obvious excitement compared to reaching for the mom and the big smile and laughter directed at the big brother."
1020-1,"The baby looks intently at the father with a neutral, wide-eyed expression.

**Explanation:** When the father leans in and says ""Hi,"" the baby maintains eye contact but does not smile, laugh, or show outward excitement, appearing calm and observant but relatively unemotional compared to the reactions shown towards the mother and brother."
1020-7,C
1031-0,"The man is experiencing **shock and disbelief**.

This is evident from his increasingly wide eyes, open mouth, and eventual gesture of covering his mouth as the auction bids for the banana artwork escalate to millions of dollars, something seemingly unbelievable or astonishing to him as he holds a regular banana himself."
1031-3,"No, the man is not feeling calm and relaxed.

**Explanation:** His eyes widen significantly, his mouth opens in astonishment, and he leans forward with a look of disbelief as the auction prices escalate rapidly. He also raises his hand towards his mouth, a gesture indicating shock, appearing stunned by the high bids."
1031-1,"The man in the white shirt is experiencing escalating **shock and disbelief**.

His eyes widen progressively, his posture changes, and he eventually covers his mouth as the auction bids for the banana artwork climb from $800,000 to over $5 million, reflecting his growing astonishment at the perceived value of the piece."
1031-2,"Yes; his facial expressions and gestures in the video clearly demonstrate that he is increasingly shocked and taken aback by the dramatic rise in auction bids for the banana artwork. His reactions, including widening eyes, an open mouth, and eventually covering his mouth, escalate in tandem with the auctioneer calling out higher and higher prices, culminating in astonishment at the final multi-million dollar bid."
1031-7,C
1044-1,"The person under the quilt appears **startled, confused, and disoriented**.

**Explanation:** They were abruptly woken from sleep by loud, intense game sounds played directly into their ears via headphones. Their wide eyes and immediate, somewhat automatic handling of the game controller suggest a startled reflex and confusion about the sudden shift from sleep to a simulated high-stress environment, likely still experiencing grogginess (sleep inertia) while instinctively reacting to the stimuli."
1044-0,"The person under the quilt is experiencing several overlapping psychological activities:

1.  **Startle Reflex:** The sudden, loud game sounds trigger an involuntary, rapid defensive response, causing the initial jolt awake.
2.  **Sleep Inertia:** Upon waking abruptly, the individual is in a state of grogginess, disorientation, and impaired cognitive function. This explains the confused look and delayed understanding of the situation.
3.  **Procedural Memory Activation / Conditioned Response:** The specific game sounds act as strong cues, automatically activating well-learned motor sequences (grabbing and using the controller) associated with playing the game. This happens almost reflexively before full conscious awareness and situational assessment catch up, likely due to the lag in higher-level cognitive functions (like those managed by the prefrontal cortex) coming online after sleep."
1044-7,B
1044-3,"No. The video shows the blond-haired person is asleep under the quilt while passively holding a controller. Another individual places headphones on them and then starts playing a game loudly, startling the sleeping person awake. Their confused reaction indicates they were not playing the game beforehand."
1044-2,"Yes, the sleeping person appears startled and confused. The video shows them instinctively grabbing their controller and looking around with a puzzled expression immediately after being awakened by the loud game sounds."

1045-1,He puts his arm around him likely out of concern and to offer comfort after startling him significantly with the prank reveal. He releases him once the initial shock appears to have passed and the individual seems okay or is recovering.
1045-3,"No, the physical interaction between the person on the left and the one in the tie-dye hoodie was not a celebration of a successful magic trick.

The gesture appears to be a way to control or manage the younger boy's startled reaction to the prank's reveal, rather than a mutual celebration. It seems intended to restrain him, possibly keep him quiet, or extend the startling effect of the trick, serving a purpose other than expressing shared joy over the outcome."
1045-0,"The person on the left puts his arm around the person in the tie-dye hoodie primarily to reassure and comfort him immediately after startling him with the prank, showing it wasn't real. He releases him as their mother enters the room and he shifts his attention to address her, downplaying the situation by saying they are having a ""great time""."
1045-7,A
1045-2,"Yes, the person on the left put his arm around the one in the tie-dye hoodie immediately as the woman entered the room. The timing strongly suggests this was a quick reaction intended to distract the woman from his loud yell and the other boy's shocked reaction to the prank reveal, making the situation seem less alarming than it appeared. However, the boy in the tie-dye hoodie did not faint; he was visibly startled and reacted dramatically to the prank."
1049-2,"No, the person did not hit the dog with the slipper. Although the person picks up the slipper, they use their hand to gently touch the dog, which then gets up and turns off the light switch."
1049-3,"No, the person does not appear to be expressing frustration or annoyance by tapping the dog with the slipper. The action seems to be a gentle nudge rather than an aggressive hit, lacking the force or tense body language typically associated with frustration. The dog's calm reaction, simply getting up and moving, also suggests the tap was not perceived as hostile or driven by annoyance, but rather as a cue to move."
1049-0,"The person wants the dog to turn off the light switch.

**Explanation:** The person is comfortable in bed and doesn't want to get up. They toss the slipper as a cue for the trained dog to go and turn off the light, demonstrating a desire for convenience through the dog's action."
1049-1,"The intention behind the person tapping the dog with the slipper is to signal or cue the dog to perform a trained action, which is to go and interact with the light switch, presumably to turn it off. It's presented as a humorous way to achieve this task conveniently without the person having to do it directly."
1049-7,B
1046-7,C
1046-1,The person in the black hat tossed the individual in the gray T-shirt into the pool because the individual in the gray T-shirt initiated physical contact by grabbing him around the upper body immediately following their verbal exchange.
1046-2,"Yes.

The video shows the person initially wearing a black shirt (who later changes into a gray T-shirt) pushing the person wearing the black hat into the pool. After getting out, the person in the black hat chases down the other individual and throws them into the pool, indicating a retaliatory action for being pushed in earlier."
1046-0,"The person wearing the black hat threw the person in the gray T-shirt into the swimming pool as retaliation.

This was because, moments earlier, the person (who was initially wearing a black shirt before changing into the gray T-shirt) had pushed the man in the black hat into the pool first. The man in the hat then got out, chased, and confronted the individual before throwing him into the pool in return."
1046-3,"Yes. The action appears to be a playful retaliation, as the person in the gray T-shirt had earlier pushed the person in the black hat into the pool. Both individuals were smiling and laughing during the second interaction when the person in the black hat threw the person in the gray T-shirt into the pool, indicating it was a reciprocal prank understood by both as lighthearted fun."
1053-0,"The man in the black T-shirt appears to be expressing playfulness or making a joke.

**Explanation:** He briefly covers his face with the hooded item and then immediately lowers it while smiling and looking at his seatmate (and possibly the camera). This quick hide-and-reveal action, combined with the smile, suggests a lighthearted, non-serious intention, like feigned shyness, a simple joke, or a playful reaction to being observed."
1053-3,"No, the man is not raising a hat. He is wearing a hoodie and pulls the hood further down over his face, then smiles at the person sitting next to him. This action is inconsistent with a greeting gesture."
1053-1,"The man in the black T-shirt (under the hoodie) is likely trying to convey a friendly acknowledgment or greeting to his seatmate.

*Brief Explanation:* By briefly lifting his hood, making eye contact, and smiling, he is breaking the ice and establishing a polite, non-verbal connection with the person he will be sitting next to for the flight. It's a common social courtesy to acknowledge someone in close proximity, signaling friendliness and openness without necessarily initiating a full conversation."
1053-2,"No, the man in the black T-shirt is wearing a hoodie, not a hat. He adjusts his hoodie, pulling it over his face, *after* the other passenger has already sat down in the middle seat, suggesting it's a reaction rather than an attempt to make the seat appear occupied beforehand."
1053-7,A
1051-1,"The man in black, shown as a baby in the photo, is biting his hand. This is likely a common infant behavior reflecting a normal developmental stage. It could be related to teething, self-exploration (discovering senses through oral exploration), or a self-soothing mechanism for comfort. It primarily signifies an immediate physical sensation or need typical of infancy."
1051-7,C
1051-3,"The gesture (bringing his hand to his mouth while laughing) appears to be primarily a spontaneous reaction to the humor and affection of the moment – the playful act of sitting on his elderly relative's lap. While the gesture itself is tied to laughter, the entire interaction, especially when contrasted with the childhood photo shown immediately after, is deeply rooted in sentimentality and nostalgia, highlighting their long-standing bond and the passage of time."
1051-2,"**No.** The adult man covers his mouth/chin area with his **right** hand while laughing. The baby in the photo has his **left** hand/fingers in or near his mouth. The specific actions (covering mouth while laughing vs. fingers in mouth) and the hands used are different. The adult's gesture appears to be a common, natural reaction to laughing heartily in that situation, rather than a deliberate mimicry of the specific pose in the baby picture."
1051-0,"The man bites his hand to playfully and accurately mimic his pose as a baby in the old photograph being recreated. It's an expression of nostalgia, humor, and affection, celebrating the shared history and bond with the older man by faithfully reenacting a past moment."
1055-0,"The enlightenment value demonstrated is the importance of **reason and caution when interacting with potentially dangerous tools.**

**Explanation:** The video starkly illustrates the negative consequences of acting impulsively and ignoring basic safety principles around household appliances. By observing the painful outcome of placing a hand inside an active blender, the viewer is encouraged to use reason to understand cause and effect – specifically, that sharp, fast-moving blades pose a significant risk. This reinforces the value of thinking before acting, respecting the dangers of machinery, and prioritizing personal safety over carelessness or attempts at creating shocking content. It highlights the rational need for safety precautions."
1055-1,"Never place any body part inside a blender while it is plugged in or operating. Misusing household appliances, especially those with blades like blenders, can lead to immediate, severe, and unintended injuries, demonstrating that actions involving potentially dangerous equipment have serious consequences."
1055-2,"No, the video does not have high enlightenment value due to its humorous depiction. Its potential value lies in illustrating the negative consequences of pranks that cause genuine distress, raising ethical questions about content creation, and highlighting the importance of empathy, rather than deriving value from the humor of the situation itself, which is overshadowed by the depicted fear and subsequent need for consolation."
1055-3,"Yes, the enlightenment value of this video is low. The video primarily depicts a prank intended to shock viewers by simulating a gruesome accident with ketchup. Its main appeal lies in the visceral reaction it provokes rather than any structured attempt to educate or provide deeper insight. The focus is on the spectacle and emotional impact of the prank itself, not on conveying knowledge, fostering critical thinking, or offering meaningful understanding beyond the immediate event."
1055-7,A
1075-0,"The video splices together shots of Peter Parker's ordinary life and his life as Spider-Man to illustrate the profound personal cost and emotional burden of his dual identity. It contrasts his everyday struggles, vulnerabilities, and romantic disappointments as Peter with the immense responsibility, isolation, and sacrifices required of him as Spider-Man, emphasizing how his heroic duties prevent him from achieving the personal happiness and normalcy he desires."
1075-7,B
1075-3,"No, the montage does more than simply suggest they are the same person.

**Explanation:**

The video intentionally interweaves scenes of Peter Parker's everyday life (social awkwardness, professional duties, romantic longing, being bullied) with scenes of Spider-Man. Crucially, it includes the moment where Spider-Man explicitly removes his mask, revealing Peter Parker underneath. Furthermore, the editing juxtaposes Peter's personal struggles and desires (like asking, ""Am I not supposed to have what I want?"") directly with Spider-Man's burdens (""What I need?""), highlighting the conflict and connection inherent in his dual identity, rather than just suggesting the identity itself."
1075-1,"The purpose of splicing together shots of Peter Parker's ordinary life and his life as Spider-Man is to highlight the profound personal sacrifices, emotional burden, and inherent conflict of his dual identity.

It contrasts his everyday vulnerabilities, desires for normalcy, and struggles (like longing for MJ, facing bullies, job difficulties) with the immense responsibility, isolation, and physical/emotional toll of being Spider-Man. This juxtaposition visually demonstrates that his heroic actions come at the direct cost of his personal happiness and the life he wants, emphasizing the theme of sacrifice central to the character."
1075-2,"No. The video splices shots of Peter Parker's ordinary life and his Spider-Man persona primarily to emphasize the personal sacrifices, emotional burdens, internal conflicts, and loneliness associated with living a dual life, rather than highlighting the exclusion of other ordinary people."
1064-3,"No, the man was not surprised by the firework exploding unexpectedly.

His actions, such as deliberately lighting the fuse, running away for safety, and then returning to crouch and brace himself with an apprehensive expression while the fuse was still burning, clearly indicate he was anticipating the explosion. He was preparing for the loud noise and impact he knew was coming."
1064-7,B
1064-0,"The man is surprised because after lighting the fuse and running away, he returned too soon. He likely misjudged how quickly the fuse would burn or how long he should stay away. Upon returning, he realized the firework was about to explode imminently while he was dangerously close, leading to his shocked expression."
1064-2,"Yes, the man is surprised and terrified because, despite running a long distance to escape, he finds himself right back next to the lit bomb just as it's about to explode. His expression of shock, wide eyes, and covering his ears are directed at the immediate danger of the sparking fuse and the impending explosion he thought he had fled."
1064-1,"The man's surprise is caused by the firecracker's fuse suddenly emitting intense sparks and smoke right next to his head. He had run away after lighting it but returned and crouched beside it, only to realize it was actively burning down and about to explode while he was dangerously close."
1080-0,"The man peels the carrot with a standard vegetable peeler to show the simple, common-sense solution to the task. His expression, often interpreted as amazement, is actually his signature deadpan look of exasperation and disbelief, highlighting the absurdity and unnecessary complexity of the previous method (modifying a spoon) when a perfectly suitable tool (the peeler) already exists and works efficiently."
1080-1,"The man peels the carrot with a standard vegetable peeler to demonstrate the simple and obvious solution after a previous clip showed someone elaborately modifying a spoon to do the same job inefficiently. His expression isn't amazement, but his signature deadpan look, silently mocking the unnecessary complexity of the first method and highlighting how much easier it is to use the correct, readily available tool."
1080-2,"Yes, the man's reaction, characterized by his deadpan expression and simple demonstration with a standard peeler, indicates perplexity and amusement. He doesn't understand why the previous person went through the elaborate and unnecessary trouble of modifying a spoon when a readily available and efficient tool (a vegetable peeler) exists for the task. His gesture highlights the obvious and much simpler alternative."
1080-7,C
1080-3,"No, the man (Khaby Lame) did not feel surprised.

His reaction is characteristic of his style, where he demonstrates that a simple, readily available tool (a standard vegetable peeler) performs the task effectively and easily, contrasting it with the overly complicated method (modifying a spoon) shown previously. He highlights the practicality and simplicity of the existing tool rather than expressing surprise at the makeshift one."
1081-1,"The small green bricks represent mouthwash. In the video, they are poured into the LEGO mimic's mouth, shaken around as if being swished, and then poured out into a basin, simulating the action of using mouthwash during the oral hygiene routine."
1081-0,"The little green bricks represent **mouthwash**.

They are poured into the mimic's mouth, swished around, and then spat out, simulating the action of using mouthwash as part of the oral hygiene routine shown in the video."
1081-3,"No, the little green bricks in the video do not represent grass. The video shows a demonstration of an oral hygiene routine for a LEGO mimic, and the narrator explicitly states that the green pieces are being used as mouthwash, followed by actions simulating swishing and spitting."
1081-2,"Yes, the little green bricks in the video represent mouthwash. The presenter explicitly states they are using mouthwash, pours the green LEGO pieces into the mimic's mouth, shakes the mimic to simulate swishing, and then empties the pieces into a basin to simulate spitting."
1081-7,C
1087-3,"No, the circle on the left does not actually move in the direction indicated by the arrow. It is an optical illusion where the changing direction of the arrow inside the static circle tricks your brain into perceiving movement that isn't really happening. The circle itself remains stationary."
1087-0,"The circle on the left is not actually moving from the camera's perspective. According to the video's explanation, the perceived movement is an optical illusion created by the changing colors within the ring and the directional cue of the arrow, tricking the brain into seeing motion where there is none. Covering the arrow reveals the circle's static nature."
1087-1,"The circle on the left *appears* to move in the direction indicated by the arrow inside it at any given moment. This direction changes throughout the video (starting by pointing right, then down, left, up, etc.).

**Explanation:** This perceived movement is an optical illusion. As explained in the video, the circle itself is actually stationary, but the changing arrow and potentially the color shifts trick the brain into seeing motion in the arrow's direction."
1087-2,"Yes, that is correct. The video demonstrates an optical illusion where the changing internal arrow makes the stationary circle appear to move. Covering the arrow removes this misleading cue, revealing that the circle itself is not actually shifting position."
1087-7,C
1090-0,"From the perspective of the goats in the video, the person's drawing on the ground likely appears as a real, three-dimensional obstacle or hazard across the path.

**Explanation:**

The drawing uses techniques like perspective lines and shading to create an optical illusion of depth and structure. To the goats, this translates into perceiving:

1.  **A Physical Barrier:** The strong horizontal line at the top and the vertical ""pillars"" can look like a solid structure, such as a low bridge, a platform, or a series of blocks they cannot easily walk through or over.
2.  **Holes or Gaps:** The shaded areas underneath the top ""surface"" and between the ""pillars"" can appear as dangerous holes, trenches, or drop-offs in the path, which they instinctively avoid.
3.  **An Unexpected Change in Terrain:** The sudden appearance of this complex, contrasting pattern disrupts the familiar flat surface of the path, signaling a potential hazard or unstable ground, causing hesitation and avoidance.

The combination of these visual cues tricks the goats' depth perception, making the flat drawing seem like a tangible object or dangerous area they need to navigate around."
1090-1,"The painting on the ground appears to the goats as a real physical obstacle or barrier.

**Explanation:** The 3D optical illusion successfully tricks the goats' visual perception, making them interpret the flat drawing as having actual depth, like gaps or holes in the path. This perceived hazard causes them to hesitate, slow down, and ultimately alter their course to walk around the drawing rather than straight across it, demonstrating they see it as a genuine impediment."
1090-2,"Yes, the painting on the ground appears to look like a barrier or a structure with gaps (similar to a broken or low bridge) to the goats.

The chalk drawing uses perspective and shading to create a convincing 3D optical illusion of a physical obstacle with holes or trenches on the path. The goats react to this illusion by hesitating and then diverting their path to walk around the drawing, indicating they perceive it as a real impediment they cannot or should not cross directly."
1090-3,"No, the painting on the ground likely does not appear to the sheep like a large puddle.

The drawing is a 3D optical illusion designed to look like a gap, hole, or drop in the concrete path. The sheep hesitate and carefully walk around the edges of the drawing, avoiding the area depicted as a void, which suggests they perceive it as a physical obstacle or hazard, not simply water."
1090-7,D
1091-3,"No, that is not true. Three distinct figures can be identified in the painting shown in the video: a woman sitting on a bench reading, a man standing behind her, and a third figure, a woman, visible further in the background walking up a path."
1091-2,"No, that description is not entirely accurate.

While there are indeed three people visible in the image – one person sitting on a bench reading a book, and another person in dark clothing standing behind her – the third person does not match your description. The third figure is in the distance, further up the path near a building, appears to be wearing a light-colored dress (not clearly pink), and is not standing next to the man in dark clothing."
1091-1,"Three individuals are visible in the painting.

1.  **A woman:** She is seated on a bench in the foreground, wearing a white dress, and is engrossed in reading a book.
2.  **An older man:** He stands to the right, slightly behind the woman. He has a long grey beard, wears a dark hooded robe, and holds a book.
3.  **A distant figure:** Further back in the landscape, near a building on a hill, a smaller figure dressed in white can be seen.

**Explanation:** The three figures are clearly depicted at different depths within the scene: the woman prominently in the foreground, the man slightly behind her, and the third figure much smaller in the background, indicating distance."
1091-0,"Based on dual perception, **4** people can be identified.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Three individuals within the scene:** A woman sitting and reading, an older man standing behind her, and a smaller figure walking in the background.
2.  **One emergent figure:** The overall composition (arch, figures, landscape) forms the large face of an old man, which is the second layer of perception in this optical illusion."
1091-7,B
1101-0,"The man carefully lowers the paper cutout so that only its bottom edge touches the water, rather than submerging it. This is done primarily **to create the visual illusion that the figure of the goddess Durga is standing or floating on the water's surface** for the photograph or video being taken.

Additionally, keeping the paper mostly dry **prevents it from getting soaked, warping, losing color, or disintegrating**, which would happen if it were actually submerged. This preserves the cutout for the shot and potentially for reuse."
1101-1,"The man slowly dipped the piece of paper into the water to carefully position the cutout of the goddess Durga just at the water's surface.

This precise placement, combined with the subsequent low camera angle, was done to create the visual illusion that the goddess figure is standing or floating majestically on the river. It uses the natural environment as a dynamic background and employs a simple form of forced perspective to make the small cutout appear significant within the scene for the video recording."
1101-7,A
1101-3,"No, the purpose was not to make the paper completely wet.

The slow and careful placement was intended to create the visual illusion that the paper cutout figure is standing or floating on the surface of the water, likely for a photograph or video. By only allowing the very bottom edge to touch the water, they achieve this effect without submerging or fully wetting the cutout."
1101-2,"No, the man did not submerge the paper gradually to create an effect of it emerging from the water.

**Explanation:** The video shows the man carefully placing the base of the paper cutout directly onto the surface of the water. He lowers it just enough for it to rest at the water level, rather than pushing it underwater and then revealing it. The final effect relies on this precise surface placement."
1095-0,"The person in the upper left corner (CLIP -1) throws a small stone into the blue bucket filled with water.

**Explanation:** They do this to create a splash in the water, likely while simultaneously filming or photographing the bucket with the smartphone they are holding, aiming to capture the effect of the stone hitting the water."
1095-1,"The person in the upper left corner (Clip -1) did not throw a stone into the bucket. They were positioning a smartphone near the bucket and rocks.

The likely reason for this action was to film the foreground scene (the bucket, rocks, and railway tracks). This footage serves as a base layer, or ""plate,"" for a visual effect. Later, footage of the other person (seen in Clips 2 and 3) was likely composited onto this base layer to create the final result, making it appear as though the person is miniature and interacting with the bucket."
1095-2,"Yes, the person in the upper left corner (CLIP -1) threw a small stone into the blue bucket. This action was done specifically to capture the splash effect, which was then edited into the ""FINAL RESULT"" scene to create the visual illusion of the miniature person jumping into the bucket and causing the splash."
1095-3,"No, the person throwing the stone in the upper left corner does not cause someone to appear inside the bucket. The final result showing a miniature person in the bucket is achieved through video editing techniques and special effects, creating an illusion rather than a real physical outcome of the action."
1095-7,C
1111-0,"The woman in the dark red/maroon saree, seated second from the left, decided to sit back down. She briefly lifted herself from the wall as if to stand when the dancer was near her, but then settled back into her seated position as he moved towards the woman next to her."
1111-3,"No, the man in the white shirt did not decide to sit down after standing up. He remained seated on the wall throughout the entire video clip and did not stand up at any point."
1111-1,"The woman in the maroon/dark red patterned saree chose to sit back down. She briefly stood up or lifted herself from her seat when the dancer performed a move near the ground in front of her, but she immediately sat back down as he stood up and moved towards the next woman."
1111-2,"Yes.

**Explanation:** At the 0:02 mark, as the dancer rises from his ground move, the woman in the brown and red sari (second from the left) visibly starts to push herself up as if to stand. However, she immediately sits back down by 0:03 and remains seated while the dancer begins interacting with the woman next to her. This action indicates she considered standing but ultimately chose to remain seated."
1111-7,D
1112-1,"The man in the **blue shirt** picked up the firework.

**Explanation:** The flashback sequence in the video (around 0:14-0:16) clearly shows the man in the blue shirt reaching back and grabbing the firework from under the bucket as they both ran away, while the man in the pink shirt just ran. This is why the man in the pink shirt later found only the lighter under the bucket."
1112-7,A
1112-3,"No, it was not the person in the pink/light-colored shirt who took the firework.

**Explanation:** The video shows the man in the pink shirt approaching the bucket after they initially ran away. He lifts the bucket and finds only the lighter, indicating the firework is missing. The narration explicitly states that ""his friend"" (the man in the blue shirt who ran into the small building) had taken the firework. The subsequent explosion inside the building and the blue-shirted man emerging covered in soot confirm he had the firework with him."
1112-0,"The man in the blue shirt took the firework.

He ran into the small building to hide after lighting the fuse. His friend later checked under the bucket and found only the lighter. The explosion then occurred inside the building where the man in the blue shirt was hiding, confirming he had taken the firework with him."
1112-2,"Yes, the person in the blue shirt took the firework instead of the lighter.

The video shows both men initially setting up the firework under the bucket. When they run for cover, the man in the blue shirt runs into the small brick structure. Later, the man in the pink shirt checks under the bucket and finds only the lighter, indicating the firework is gone. Immediately after, an explosion occurs inside the structure, and the man in the blue shirt emerges covered in soot, confirming he took the firework with him into the building where it detonated."
1117-0,"The man in the blue shirt made the water overflow and failed the challenge.

**Explanation:** The glass was filled beyond its rim, with the water held in place by surface tension, creating a visible bulge above the edge. During his turn, the man in the blue shirt added the final few drops of water which were enough to break this surface tension, causing the excess water to spill over the side."
1117-1,"The man in the blue shirt was responsible for the water overflowing. He added the final drops of water which broke the surface tension, causing the water to spill over the edge of the glass."
1117-3,"No, the person in the red shirt did not make the water overflow and fail the challenge.

The person in the blue shirt added the final drops of water at the end (around 0:49-0:50), which caused the surface tension to break and the water to spill over the edge of the glass. The person in the red shirt had successfully completed their turn just before this."
1117-2,"No, the person in the blue shirt did cause the water to overflow, but he did not fail the challenge.

**Explanation:**

The challenge appears to be filling the glass as much as possible using surface tension, allowing the water level to dome above the rim. The person in the blue shirt deliberately taps the faucet (0:48-0:49), adding the final drops that break the surface tension and cause the overflow. The immediate celebratory reactions from everyone, including him grabbing the glass to drink (0:51-0:56) and the others cheering (0:57), indicate that causing the overflow after reaching the maximum capacity was the intended successful conclusion of the challenge, not a failure."
1117-7,D
1121-2,"Yes, the symbol closest to the filament light bulb on the control panel does depict three clouds. The symbol is located on the red/orange section of the panel and clearly shows three white, puffy cloud shapes."
1121-0,"The symbol closest to the filament light bulb in the control panel is **Clouds**.

The light bulb is positioned directly above the red section of the control panel, which features illustrations of white clouds."
1121-1,"The symbol nearest to the filament light bulb on the control panel is **white clouds**.

**Explanation:** When the view goes inside the cloud (around 0:08-0:10), a control panel is visible. On the left side is a lit filament light bulb. The segment immediately to the right of this bulb features drawings of simple white clouds on an orange/red background."
1121-7,A
1121-3,"No, the symbol closest to the filament light bulb on the control panel is not the sun.

**Explanation:** The lit filament light bulb is positioned on the far left side of the control panel assembly. The symbol directly adjacent to and below this position is the white cloud symbol. The yellow sun symbol is located further to the right on the panel."
1182-3,"No, the ladder in the video does not turn into a smaller size as it moves toward the clouds. Instead, the man throws a small, miniature ladder upwards, and it magically expands into a full-sized A-frame ladder as it travels towards the cloud before landing on the ground."
1182-0,"The man throws a miniature blue ladder towards the cloud. As it travels through the air, it appears to instantly expand, landing on the ground beneath the cloud as a full-sized, upright, blue A-frame ladder."
1182-2,"Yes, the ladder beneath the clouds in the video is made to look full-sized through video editing techniques. The video employs visual effects to show the miniature blue ladder transforming into a large blue A-frame ladder as it lands on the ground."
1182-1,"The ladder appears through a visual effect. The man holds a miniature, folded blue ladder, makes a downward throwing motion, and it instantly transforms into a full-sized, open A-frame ladder standing on the ground directly under the cloud."
1182-7,C
1119-2,"Yes, the bowl falls off the man's lap onto the dark wooden floor when he falls backward off the couch after reacting to the picture. This action causes the bowl and popcorn to spill directly in the area where the oversized, digitally enlarged phone screen graphic is superimposed."
1119-3,"No, the bowl is not on his lap when he fully reacts. The reaction to the virtual screen appearing causes the bowl to be knocked off his lap simultaneously as the screen reaches him."
1119-7,E
1119-0,"The iron bowl is on the floor.

It landed there after the person in red was startled by the image on the phone, causing him to fall backward off the couch and drop the bowl."
1119-1,"When the person in red reacts to the image, the bowl is propelled upwards and forwards from their lap. It is momentarily airborne, located above the front edge of the couch and the floor directly in front of it, in the space between the falling person and the person holding the phone, while spilling popcorn."
1124-0,"The egg falls directly into the water bottle.

Explanation: The quick horizontal push removes the support from under the egg. Due to inertia, the egg resists the horizontal motion and instead falls vertically downwards due to gravity, landing inside the bottle's opening."
1124-7,A
1124-1,"The egg falls straight down into the opening of the bottle.

**Explanation:** When the performer strikes the bottle, the bottle moves quickly sideways. Due to inertia, the egg initially resists this horizontal motion and stays relatively in place. Once the bottle is no longer beneath it, gravity pulls the egg vertically downwards, causing it to fall directly into the bottle's opening."
1124-2,"No, the egg is not behind the water bottle or in the person's hand after the push.

The egg falls straight down into the opening of the water bottle and lands in the water inside. This happens because of inertia; the quick sideways push moves the bottle, but the egg tends to stay in its original position momentarily, allowing gravity to pull it vertically downwards into the bottle's mouth."
1124-3,"**Yes.** The video shows a hand pushing down sharply on an egg positioned over the mouth of a water bottle. The egg successfully goes inside the bottle, causing water to splash out."
1122-7,A
1122-0,"At the end of the video, the little man in the overalls with the white bag is inside the vacuum cleaner.

**Explanation:** The video shows the miniature man looking up in terror as the vacuum cleaner nozzle descends towards him in the miniature world under the couch. The scene immediately cuts back to the real-world man holding the nozzle, having just finished vacuuming that spot. This sequence strongly implies that the man was sucked into the vacuum cleaner along with the dust bunnies."
1122-2,"No, the video does not explicitly show the little man ending up inside the vacuum cleaner. Just as he is being pulled towards the nozzle, the scene cuts back to the person vacuuming, leaving the man's final fate ambiguous, although it is strongly implied he was vacuumed up."
1122-1,"At the conclusion of the video, the little man in overalls with the white bag ends up inside the vacuum cleaner.

**Explanation:** The animated sequence clearly shows the man being forcefully pulled upwards and disappearing into the large vacuum cleaner nozzle that descends upon the miniature scene. The video then immediately cuts back to the real-world person holding that same vacuum hose, looking puzzled, implying that the little man was just sucked into the machine he is operating."
1122-3,"No, the little man in overalls is not inside the janitor's closet at the end of the video. He is shown emerging *from* the janitor's closet at the beginning of the fantasy sequence and is outside in the oversized environment when that sequence concludes, just before the scene cuts back to the man vacuuming in the real world."
1127-1,"From the camera's viewpoint in the third segment:

The shooter is positioned in the midground on the indoor basketball court, closer to the camera. He is dribbling the ball and moving towards the basket. The target basket is located in the background, at the far end of the court, mounted high on a backboard. Therefore, the shooter is between the camera and the more distant basket."
1127-0,"In the third segment (the indoor court scene), Jake (the ball shooter) is positioned in the mid-ground, initially slightly left-of-center, and moves towards the right side of the frame. The camera is positioned behind him, following his movement. The target basket is located in the background on the right side of the frame, which is the direction Jake is moving towards."
1127-3,"No, the target basket is not positioned directly in front of the ball shooter. It is located slightly to his left."
1127-2,"No, the target basket in the third segment is located in front of the man. He is facing generally towards the basket and the camera as he executes the shot, even though the throw itself is an unconventional over-the-head/shoulder motion."
1134-1,"The trajectory of the ball upon release was **upward and forward**.

**Explanation:** When Jake released the ball around the 0:12 mark, his throwing motion propelled the ball both upwards, to achieve the necessary arc, and forwards, in the direction of the basketball hoop."
1134-2,"No, the ball did not bounce back after hitting the ring because it missed the hoop entirely. The video shows the ball sailing completely over the backboard and ring without making contact."
1134-7,B
1127-7,A
1134-3,"No, the ball did not descend directly towards the basketball hoop. It hit the backboard, bounced upwards, contacted the top edge of the backboard, and then fell away from the hoop, missing the shot."
1134-0,"After being released by the person in the first throw of the last scene, the ball traveled upward and forward in a high, arcing trajectory. It followed a curved path through the air towards the basketball hoop."
1130-1,"The red ball showed the most movement. This occurred because the frequency at which the base was moved matched the natural frequency of the red ball on the longest rod, causing resonance and amplifying its swing significantly compared to the other balls."
1130-2,"No, the red ball did not move significantly when the base holding the other balls was struck.

**Explanation:** The red ball is suspended independently and is not connected to the base that was hit. The force was applied only to the stand holding the blue and green balls. Due to inertia, the red ball remained relatively stationary as its support system was not directly impacted."
1130-3,"No, the blue ball did not move significantly when the man tapped the base.

**Explanation:** It was the red ball, located furthest from the point of impact, that exhibited the most significant swinging motion. This occurs because the tap introduces energy into the coupled pendulum system, and this energy is transferred through the base, primarily exciting a mode of oscillation where the red ball swings with the largest amplitude."
1130-0,"The blue and green balls moved significantly when the old man swung his arm the largest magnitude.

**Explanation:** The blue and green balls are mounted on rods connected directly to the mechanism being moved by the man's hand via the handle. A larger swing of his arm translates to a larger displacement of the mechanism, which in turn causes a larger amplitude swing for the directly connected blue and green balls. The red ball appears to be suspended independently and its motion is not directly driven by the magnitude of the handle's movement."
1130-7,A
1159-1,"The fifth stationery item displayed in the video is **Highlighters**, and the seventh stationery item displayed is **Eraser**.

**Explanation:** This identification is based on the sequential order in which the stationery items are presented in the video. Counting through the items as they appear, Highlighters are shown fifth, and Eraser is shown seventh."
1159-0,"The fifth item shown in the video is **Highlighters**, and the seventh item is **Eraser**.

**Explanation:** The video presents a list of stationery items sequentially. By counting the items as they appear on screen:
1. Notebooks
2. Pencils
3. Pens
4. Sticky notes
5. **Highlighters**
6. Measurement scale (Ruler)
7. **Eraser**
8. Sharpener
9. Glue

Therefore, Highlighters are the fifth item and Eraser is the seventh item shown."
1159-7,A
1159-2,"Yes, the fifth item shown in the video is a set of Stabilo Boss pastel highlighters, clearly labeled ""Highlighters"", and the seventh item displayed is a collection of pastel block erasers, labeled ""Eraser""."
1159-3,"No, that is incorrect. According to the video, the fifth item shown is ""Highlighters"", and the seventh item shown is ""Eraser"". Sticky notes are the fourth item, and the measurement scale (ruler) is the sixth item."
1145-0,"12 hours have passed.

**Explanation:**
The first time the woman checks her phone as an adult, the time is 8:00. The second time she checks it, the time is 20:00. The difference between 8:00 (8 AM) and 20:00 (8 PM) is 12 hours."
1145-2,"Yes, the woman checks her phone 12 hours apart as an adult.

The phone initially displays 8:00. When she checks it again later in the ""adult"" segment, it displays 20:00. Using the 24-hour time format, 20:00 is equivalent to 8:00 PM, indicating that exactly 12 hours have passed since the initial 8:00 check (presumably 8:00 AM)."
1145-1,"**Answer:** 12 hours.
**Explanation:** In the ""How time feels as an adult"" segment, the woman first checks her phone, which displays 8:00. Later, she checks it again, and the time shown is 20:00. The difference between 20:00 and 8:00 is 12 hours."
1145-7,D
1145-3,"Yes. Explanation: In the ""adult"" segment, she explicitly checks her phone screen at 0:18 and again at 0:28. These two checks occur within a 10-second interval, which is less than a minute."
1137-0,"When the woman is upside down, the head of the man in white is facing towards the ground.

**Explanation:** The man performs a flip or handstand maneuver simultaneously with the woman, resulting in both of them being upside down. Therefore, his head is oriented downwards towards the grass."
1137-1,"The man in white is looking **upward**.

He is looking up at the woman and child whom he is supporting above him."
1137-3,"Yes, the man's head is facing downward. In the final pose, the man performs a handstand supported by the woman's back, which means his body is inverted and his head is oriented towards the ground."
1137-7,D
1137-2,"No. When the man is upside down (around the 0:04-0:05 mark), his head is pointing downwards toward the ground because he is inverted. His back is also largely facing the camera, meaning his head is directed away from it, not towards it."
1160-1,"The fourth toy displayed in the video is a dark, rectangular, chunky metal slider with an intricate engraved design on its surface.

**Explanation:** It appears fourth in the sequence, starting around the 0:15 mark, immediately following the MT-01 multi-tool fidget. The narrator specifically describes it at this point as ""just a chunky and heavy piece of metal that catches the most attention."""
1160-3,"No, the fourth item in the video is not the small black pill-shaped fidget toy. The fourth item shown (around 0:15-0:19) is a chunky, heavy black rectangular slider with an etched design on its surface. The small black pill-shaped toy is shown second in the sequence (around 0:04-0:08)."
1160-2,"Yes, the fourth item in the video is a metal fidget toy that resembles a mahjong tile.

Its resemblance comes from its chunky, rectangular block shape and the presence of an engraved design on its main face, which are characteristic features shared with traditional mahjong tiles."
1160-0,"The fourth item shown is a chunky and heavy, black rectangular magnetic slider with an engraved pattern on its surface. The video highlights it as the one that ""catches the most attention."""
1160-7,C
1161-1,"The sequence of colors shown by the long strip of light is: Yellow/Warm White, Green, Blue, Purple/Pink, Red, and finally Orange/Amber.

This sequence is observed as the light strip cycles through different colors one after another in the video."
1161-0,"The color order displayed by the long strip of light is: Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Red, Orange.

This sequence is observed as the light strip cycles through each distinct color one after the other in the video."
1161-3,"Yes, the initial color sequence displayed by the long strip of light is yellow, green, blue, purple, and red.

Explanation: The video shows the light strip cycling rapidly through these five colors in that specific order before transitioning to and holding a steady orange/yellow color."
1161-2,"No, the order displayed in the video is not exactly as listed.

The light strip cycles through yellow, green, cyan/light blue, purple/magenta, red, and orange/yellow-orange. It does not display a distinct blue color between cyan and purple."
1161-7,A
1162-2,"No. The navigation shown in the video starts with the 'Clock' option highlighted, not 'Calendar'. The user then scrolls down past 'Notes' and stops with 'Calculator' highlighted."
1162-0,"The order of the menu options browsed is: **Calendar, Clock, Notes, Calculator, Settings.**

**Explanation:** The video shows the user navigating downwards through the menu list using the navigation buttons. The highlight starts on ""Calendar"" at 0:05, then moves sequentially to ""Clock"" (0:06), ""Notes"" (0:07), ""Calculator"" (0:08), and finally ""Settings"" (0:08) as the user presses the down button."
1162-3,"Yes, the person browses through the menu options including Settings.

**Explanation:** In the video, the user scrolls down the main menu. As they highlight 'Clock' (around 0:07) and subsequent options like 'Notes' and 'Calculator', the 'Settings' option appears and remains visible at the bottom of the displayed list on the screen."
1162-1,"**Sequence:** Calendar, Clock, Notes, Calculator.
**Explanation:** The video shows the user scrolling downwards through the phone's menu. The highlight begins on ""Calendar"" (0:06), then moves sequentially to ""Clock"" (0:07), ""Notes"" (0:08), and finally rests on ""Calculator"" (0:08) before the scene changes."
1162-7,B
1168-3,"No, the man in the red hat did not fall into the hole because he was deceived. His actions were deliberate; he intentionally simulated falling into the painted chasm as a playful interaction with the 3D artwork, likely for a photo or amusement. His controlled jump and landing indicate it was a staged act, not an accidental fall caused by mistaking the painting for a real hole."
1168-0,"The man in the red hat did not fall into a real hole. He stepped onto a 3D chalk artwork designed to look like a deep chasm. He deliberately pretended to fall as a playful way to interact with the optical illusion, likely while posing for a photo or video being taken by the woman with him. This interaction highlights the effectiveness of the 3D art."
1168-2,"No, the man in the red hat did not fall into the hole because of video editing.

The ""hole"" is a 3D chalk art drawing on a flat surface, designed to create an optical illusion of depth. The man was playfully interacting with the artwork and deliberately acted out falling into the illusion for effect, rather than actually falling or being manipulated by video editing."
1168-1,"The man in the red hat did not fall into a real hole; he pretended to fall as a playful interaction with the 3D chalk artwork on the ground.

*   **Explanation:** The ""hole"" is a *trompe-l'œil* (trick of the eye) illusion painted on the pavement. The man intentionally acted as if he was falling into the depicted chasm right after asking someone to take his photo, creating a dynamic and humorous pose that engages with the artwork's illusion."
1169-0,"The person in the black and white clothes wasn't actually kicked to pieces. This is a visual illusion created using a combination of a practical stunt and video editing.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Two People, One Costume:** The ""referee"" was actually two individuals (likely the twins seen immediately after) hidden inside a single, oversized, breakaway referee uniform.
2.  **Breakaway Costume:** The uniform was designed to come apart easily (e.g., with Velcro or snaps).
3.  **Video Editing (Jump Cut):** Just as the ball appears to make contact, the video cuts.
4.  **Stunt Execution:** During the hidden cut, the two performers inside the costume quickly jumped apart, shedding the costume pieces and likely releasing extra soccer balls that were hidden inside.
5.  **The Reveal:** The video cuts back immediately to show the clothes falling and the two performers standing where the ""referee"" was, creating the illusion that the single referee figure exploded into pieces and revealed the two people."
1169-3,"No, the man in the black and white clothes was not a mannequin kicked to pieces.

It was an illusion. A person wearing the referee costume quickly shed it when the ball was kicked. Multiple soccer balls were hidden inside the costume and released simultaneously to create the effect of exploding into pieces. The man seen emerging from the pile of clothes was the person who had been hidden inside the referee outfit."
1169-2,"Yes, the effect where the man in black and white clothes disappears and is replaced by clothes and multiple soccer balls when hit by the ball is due to video editing effects. It is physically impossible for a person to disintegrate in this manner upon being struck by a soccer ball; this is a visual effect created using video editing techniques."
1169-1,"The man in the black and white clothes appeared to shatter due to a planned illusion involving two people and a breakaway costume.

**Explanation:**

The ""referee"" figure was actually a person dressed in black wearing a specially designed costume (striped shirt, pants, cap) that was held together with quick-release fasteners like Velcro or snaps. Hidden inside the costume were also several extra soccer balls.

Simultaneously, as the first man kicked the ball, the person inside the referee costume jumped. This jump, combined with the design of the breakaway costume, caused the outer referee clothes and the hidden soccer balls to fly outwards dramatically. This revealed the person in black underneath, creating the visual illusion that the referee had been ""shattered"" by the impact of the kicked ball. The kick itself served primarily as misdirection for the synchronized jump and costume release."
1169-7,D
1170-0,"The stack of containers on the ship collapses and falls apart. This happens immediately after the man in the foreground makes a throwing gesture towards the ship, appearing to trigger the collapse through visual effects."
1170-3,"No, the containers did not disappear because they fell off the ship due to instability.

This is a visual editing effect. The containers vanish instantly and cleanly without any realistic physics, such as tumbling, splashing into the water, or causing debris. The disappearance is too abrupt and unnatural for a real-world event involving heavy shipping containers."
1170-2,Yes. The containers disappear because the video uses post-production visual effects to simulate the line-clearing mechanic from the game Tetris. The way the containers flash and vanish when a row is completed is not physically possible with real containers and is a clear indicator of digital manipulation or CGI being used to create the game-like effect.
1170-1,"The containers vanished from the ship due to **video editing and visual effects (VFX)**.

**Explanation:** The instantaneous disappearance of multiple large, heavy shipping containers defies the laws of physics. This indicates the footage was digitally manipulated in post-production to create the illusion of the containers vanishing, likely using techniques like object removal, masking, or compositing. It is not a recording of a real, unedited event."
1170-7,C
1168-7,E
1175-0,"The bear's movement in the video is achieved using digital visual effects (VFX).

Here's a brief explanation:
1.  A realistic 3D digital model of a polar bear was created using computer software.
2.  This 3D model was then animated by digital artists to perform actions like roaring, standing up, and moving.
3.  The movement of the real camera filming the scene was tracked digitally (matchmoving).
4.  Finally, the animated 3D bear was digitally placed (composited) into the live-action footage, aligning it with the tracked camera movement and the street environment. Special effects were used to create the transition from the initial chalk-like appearance to the fully rendered bear, making it seem as though the drawing came to life."
1175-3,"No, the bear on the ground is not a mechanical bear moving.

The video depicts an artistic illusion where the artist's chalk drawing appears to come to life. The seamless transformation from the 2D drawing on the pavement into a 3D, moving polar bear suggests the use of video editing or CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery) rather than a physical mechanical prop."
1175-1,"The technique used is **Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI)**, a form of **Visual Effects (VFX)**.

**Explanation:** A digital 3D model of a polar bear was created and animated by artists. This animated CGI bear was then digitally inserted (composited) into the live-action video footage, replacing the area where the person was initially ""drawing."" The lighting, shadows, and perspective were carefully matched to make the bear appear realistically integrated into the scene and seem as though it came to life from the pavement."
1175-2,"Yes, the transformation of the pavement drawing into a moving polar bear is achieved through digital visual effects (VFX). The sequence uses techniques like CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery) and compositing to create the illusion of the artwork coming to life, integrating the digitally animated bear seamlessly into the live-action footage. It is not a result of editing between a physical painting and a real bear."
1175-7,A
1173-2,"No, the person in the back seat did not disappear due to post-production editing. He remains in the seat but is obscured from view by the large volume of drinks and cups that spilled and flew up when the car hit the bump."
1173-0,"The person in the back seat did not actually disappear.

He was holding numerous trays of drinks when the car hit a bump. This caused the drinks and cups to fly upwards and outwards, completely drenching him and covering him in the contents. The sheer volume of liquid, ice, and cups splashing simultaneously obscured him from view, creating the temporary illusion that he had disappeared beneath the mess."
1173-1,"The sudden jolt from the car hitting a bump caused all the drinks the person was holding to fly up violently. The person was momentarily obscured by the massive splash of liquid, ice, and flying cups, creating the illusion that they vanished under the chaos."
1173-3,"No, the person in the back seat did not disappear because the car made a sudden stop or sharp turn.

The person disappeared from view because the car hit a bump, causing a sudden jolt. The passenger explicitly warns the driver about an upcoming bump just before the incident occurs. The upward trajectory of the drinks is consistent with hitting a bump, not the forward/backward motion of a sudden stop or the sideways motion of a sharp turn."
1173-7,E
1176-0,"The plant in the man's hand did not actually grow larger. The video uses editing to create a visual trick. The man walks towards a small greenhouse holding a small plant, but when the scene cuts to the ""inside,"" it's actually a completely different, much larger location (like a botanical garden or conservatory) where a separate, giant Venus flytrap prop already exists. The man is still holding the original small plant when he encounters the giant one."
1176-2,"No, the plant in the man's hand did not appear larger due to editing. The video uses a cut or transition to switch from the man holding a small plant outside to a scene inside featuring a separate, much larger plant prop or visual effect. The giant plant is a distinct element introduced into the scene, not an enlargement of the original small one."
1176-7,B
1176-1,"The plant in the man's hand did not actually grow larger. The video uses an editing trick:

1.  The man starts by holding a normal-sized Venus flytrap outside a small greenhouse.
2.  When he steps through the greenhouse door, there is a cut or transition.
3.  He is then shown in a completely different, larger location (like a conservatory or jungle set) where a separate, giant Venus flytrap prop already exists.

The illusion of growth is created by switching scenes and props through editing, not by the original plant changing size."
1176-3,"No, the plant did not grow larger because of a change in perspective. The apparent growth is achieved through visual effects, likely involving editing techniques like a jump cut and digital compositing to replace the small plant with a much larger version after the man enters the doorway."
1177-2,"Yes, the man appeared on the other boat due to video editing and visual effects.

*   **Explanation:** Before performing the action, the man explicitly states to the onlookers that the trick is ""edited."" Visually, he jumps into the water near the pier, and in the very next moment, he is shown standing on a boat located some distance away. This instantaneous and physically impossible change of location confirms that the effect was achieved using video editing techniques, specifically a cut between two different shots."
1177-0,"The man appeared to suddenly stand on the other boat through **video editing**.

**Explanation:** The video uses a common editing trick. The camera recorded him jumping into the water from the pier. Then, the recording likely stopped. After the man got onto the boat (by swimming or other means not shown), the camera started recording again from a similar position. These two separate video clips were then joined together in post-production, cutting out the time and action it took for him to actually travel from the pier to the boat, creating the illusion of an instant transfer. The man himself mentions ""it's edited"" just before performing the stunt."
1177-1,"The technique used is a **hidden cut** achieved through **video editing**.

**Explanation:** Two separate video clips were filmed: one where the man jumps off the pier into the water, and another where he is already on the boat further away. The video editor then cut from the first clip (likely during the splash to mask the transition) directly to the second clip, creating the seamless illusion that he instantly appeared on the boat."
1177-7,B
1177-3,"No, the man did not swim to the other boat using the towel as a distraction.

The video uses editing techniques, specifically a jump cut, to create the illusion of him instantly appearing on the boat after jumping from the pier. The man even mentions ""it's edited"" before performing the stunt. The towel was part of the performance setup, not a tool to conceal him swimming to and boarding the boat, as the transition happens instantaneously due to the edit."
1178-2,"Yes, the object appearing as a ""LAPTOP"" in the final scene is the original smartphone transformed by the time warp scan visual effect filter.

Explanation: The video demonstrates the time warp scan filter, where a line moves across the screen, capturing the image sequentially. By tilting the smartphone as the scan line passes over it, the filter captures different parts of the phone at different angles over time, creating the distorted V-shape that resembles an open laptop. The object itself remains the smartphone throughout the video; only its appearance is manipulated by the filter effect."
1178-3,"No, the ""laptop"" in the final scene is not a real foldable device that unfolds from the smartphone.

The apparent transformation is a visual distortion created by a video filter (likely a time warp scan filter). The filter scans across the screen, and by moving the smartphone as the scan line passes, the image is warped, creating the illusion that the phone is changing shape into a tablet or laptop. The phone itself does not physically change."
1178-1,"The ""LAPTOP"" label appears because the specific way the smartphone is tilted and moved while the time-scan filter passes over it creates a distorted image with a distinct L-shape. This L-shape visually resembles the form of an open laptop, making ""LAPTOP"" a fitting and humorous label for this particular visual effect within the transformation sequence."
1178-7,A
1178-0,"A laptop appears in the final scene because the creator bends the smartphone into an L-shape as the time-scan filter passes over it. The filter captures this manipulation, distorting the phone's image to resemble the shape of an open laptop. This is a creative use of the filter effect to continue the theme of transforming the original smartphone into different device forms, rather than showing an actual, separate laptop."
1181-1,"The technique used involves **forced perspective and framing**.

**Explanation:** The man first shows a crude painting on a canvas. He then wipes the canvas clean (making the painting ""vanish"") but leaves the empty wooden frame on the easel. By holding the empty frame up and carefully aligning it with the actual Colosseum in the background from the camera's specific viewpoint, he creates an illusion. The real Colosseum, seen *through* the empty frame, appears as if it were a perfectly realistic painting contained within that frame."
1181-3,"No, the Colosseum did not seem to disappear.

The man held up an empty frame, not a painting. He carefully aligned this frame with the actual Colosseum and the people in front of it. This created a brief illusion where the real-life scene viewed *through* the frame looked like a static picture *in* the frame. The Colosseum remained fully visible throughout; the trick was about framing reality to look like art, not making the landmark vanish."
1181-2,"No, the Colosseum did not disappear. The effect is a practical, in-camera visual trick using perspective. The artist replaces a painted canvas with an empty frame and aligns it perfectly with the real Colosseum and actors in the background. From the camera's viewpoint, the real scene viewed through the empty frame creates the illusion of being a picture on the canvas, requiring no digital post-production for the core effect."
1181-0,"The Colosseum didn't disappear. The painter created an illusion by first showing a crude painting on a canvas. He then removed the canvas and placed an empty picture frame on the easel. The ""realistic painting"" seen afterwards is actually the real Colosseum viewed through this empty frame."

1183-3,"No, the sky did not darken because the person turned off the lights. The video shows the person reaching towards the sun outside the window, and as they appear to ""grab"" it, the scene instantly transitions from bright daylight to nighttime. The person is then shown holding a glowing orb, implying they magically captured the sun, causing the darkness."
1183-2,"Yes, the visual change from bright daylight to darkness was achieved using a combination of controlled lighting changes and post-production effects.

**Explanation:**

The instantaneous shift from a brightly lit daytime scene outside the window to a dark, nighttime scene, coinciding with the character seemingly ""catching"" the sun as a glowing orb, indicates deliberate technical manipulation rather than a natural change. This effect was created using stage lighting adjustments and likely digital effects in post-production to serve the fantastical narrative of the character interacting with the sun in an impossible way."
1183-1,"The rapid change from day to night is a visual effect achieved through video editing.

*   **Explanation:** The initial bright daylight scene is instantly replaced with a nighttime scene the moment the character interacts with the light source. This physically impossible transition indicates post-production manipulation, where the daytime footage (or effect) was cut and replaced with nighttime footage, making it appear as though the character grabbed the ""sun"" and turned it into the glowing orb, causing night to fall."
1183-0,"The sky suddenly darkened because the man in the video reached out and physically pulled the sun out of the sky, holding it as a glowing orb. This action directly caused the transition from day to night, demonstrating his ability to manipulate the natural environment in a fantastical way."
1192-0,"The standing sprinkler appeared due to video editing and special effects. The object thrown did not physically transform; instead, digital techniques like CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery) or object replacement were used in post-production to make it seem as though the thrown item turned into the sprinkler upon landing."
1192-1,"The standing sprinkler appeared because the water balloon thrown by the person at 0:10 transformed into the sprinkler when it landed on the grass. This is shown as a visual effect mimicking the ""Topiary Sprinkler"" weapon from the Ratchet & Clank video game, which was mentioned earlier in the clip."
1192-7,C
1192-3,No. The sprinklers are visible standing above ground on the lawn before the projectiles hit and activate them; they were not hidden underground.
1192-2,"No, the standing sprinkler's appearance was not due to creative video editing. The video shows a person throwing the orange device, which then lands on the grass and activates, turning into a sprinkler."
1203-2,"Yes, the man (Andrey) managed to remove the towel.

He successfully removed it by holding both ends, passing one end underneath the part of the towel looped around the faucet neck, and then pulling both ends simultaneously. This action changed the configuration of the loop, allowing it to slip off the faucet."
1203-0,"Andrey successfully wrung out the towel by wrapping it tightly around the faucet spout itself. He then twisted the free end of the towel, using the faucet as a fixed anchor point. This technique provided leverage, allowing him to apply significantly more twisting force than Karina, who only tried to wring it by hand without using the faucet for assistance."
1203-1,"The man removed the towel by **unwinding or unrolling** it from the faucet spout.

**Explanation:** Instead of pulling the towel straight down against the friction of the wrap (which the woman attempted unsuccessfully), the man reversed the way the towel was wrapped. He systematically unwound the fabric from around the faucet, loosening its grip and allowing it to be lifted off easily without passing through the water stream."
1203-3,"Yes, the man (Andrey) used the detachable spray head of the faucet. He pulled the faucet head down, utilizing the flexible hose to direct the water flow and thoroughly wet the towel within the sink basin."
1203-7,B
1206-0,"**Force:** Gravity

**Explanation:** The blue paint is spilling downwards due to the force of gravity. When the man tips the paint can, gravity pulls the liquid paint towards the Earth (and onto him), causing it to fall out of the container. The text overlay ""Gravity 😑"" in the video explicitly confirms this is the force at play."
1206-3,"No, the blue paint is not spilling unusually, nor is the person holding the paint can upside down. The person holds the can upright and then intentionally tilts it forward, allowing the force of gravity to pull the liquid paint out of the opening and onto them."
1206-2,"No, the blue paint is spilling downwards onto the man, not upwards. The video clearly shows the paint falling from the can onto the person below it, which is consistent with the normal effects of gravity. There is no indication that the set is upside down or that an illusion is being created; the paint behaves exactly as expected when spilled."
1206-1,"The blue paint appears to spill towards the viewer due to the combination of gravity and the camera's perspective.

**Explanation:** Gravity pulls the paint straight downwards towards the floor. However, the camera is positioned directly underneath the paint can, looking upwards. This low angle captures the paint's vertical descent, making it seem as though the paint is falling directly onto the camera lens and, consequently, towards the viewer."
1206-7,C
1209-0,"It is impossible to determine how fast the woman is moving from the single photograph shown at the end of the video.

A still photograph captures only a single instant in time. To calculate speed, you need to know the distance traveled over a specific duration (time interval), neither of which can be measured from one static image."
1209-2,"Yes, the woman in the photo appears to be moving fast primarily due to an illusion created by the photo composition and technical execution.

The low camera angle exaggerates the splash and the movement of the leg, making the action seem more dramatic and forceful. Additionally, the use of a fast shutter speed freezes the water droplets and leaves in mid-air at the peak of the splash. Capturing this highly dynamic, transient moment creates a strong visual impression of high energy and speed, even if the actual step into the puddle wasn't particularly fast."
1209-1,"The speed of the woman in the final image is zero.

**Explanation:**

The final image is a still photograph, which captures a single, frozen moment in time. Speed is a measure of distance traveled over a period of time. Since a photograph represents an instant with no duration, there is no time element over which movement can occur *within the image itself*. While the photograph dynamically *implies* the motion that was happening when the picture was taken (the splash, the airborne leaves, the position of her leg), her velocity *at that captured instant* as represented in the static image is zero."
1209-3,"While the final photograph strongly suggests the woman is running quickly due to the dynamic leg position (high knee lift, foot angle) and the large, dramatic splash, the preceding video footage shows the action being staged. She is seen deliberately stepping into the puddle, with leaves being dropped simultaneously, to create this specific visual effect. Therefore, the appearance of running is likely an illusion created by a forceful, well-timed step or stomp for the camera, rather than actual high-speed running."
1209-7,C
1210-0,"The focus shifts from the person observing the artwork to the artwork itself.

Initially, the camera focuses more on the person looking at the photograph, placing them prominently in the foreground. The camera then pans slightly left and adjusts, bringing the framed photograph into the center of the view and making it the clear subject, while the person becomes a secondary element to the side."
1210-1,"The focus does not change throughout the video.

**Explanation:** The camera maintains a fixed focus on the framed photograph hanging on the wall, keeping it sharp and clear. The person viewing the photograph in the foreground remains consistently out of focus for the entire duration of the clip."
1210-2,"Yes, the focus of the video remains on the photograph of the two birds throughout the sequence. The photograph is the central and most prominent element in the frame during the entire clip, and the camera movement serves only to slightly adjust the view without shifting the primary subject."
1210-3,"No, the focus of the video does not shift from the background/mid-ground to the foreground. The focus remains consistently fixed on the framed photograph on the wall throughout the clip, while the person in the foreground stays slightly out of focus."
1210-7,C
1214-2,"No, the camera is not moving closer to the woman. The camera is actually moving away from her, pulling back or zooming out to reveal more of the surrounding spiral staircase and capture a wider view of the scene."
1214-1,"The camera moves upwards and pulls back (zooms out) away from the woman.

**Explanation:** The shot begins relatively close to the woman lying on the green structure at the bottom of the staircase. The camera then ascends vertically while simultaneously increasing its distance from the subject (pulling back or zooming out), revealing the surrounding spiral staircase and the architectural context."
1214-3,"**Yes.** The camera is moving physically upwards and away from the woman along the staircase. This increase in distance causes the woman to appear progressively smaller within the frame, creating a visual zoom-out effect."
1214-0,"**Zoom In:** The shot starts wide, showing the entire spiral staircase from above, and then the lens magnifies the view, bringing the woman lying on the green seating closer and making her larger within the frame without the camera physically moving significantly closer."
1214-7,C
1223-3,"Yes, the camera keeps the same angle as before during the last throw. The video is shot from a single, static camera position, and there is no panning, tilting, or zooming throughout the entire clip, ensuring the viewing angle remains constant."
1223-0,"The camera view does not differ in the last throw compared to the others. The camera remains in a fixed, static position throughout the entire video, maintaining the same angle and framing for all attempts."
1223-1,"The camera angle does not change during the final throw compared to the earlier ones. The camera remains in a fixed, static position throughout the entire sequence, providing a consistent viewpoint for all the throws shown."
1223-2,"No, the camera does not zoom in on the floor during the last throw. The camera maintains a stationary wide shot throughout the entire video, capturing all the attempts, including the final successful one, from the same fixed perspective."
1223-7,C
1225-2,"Yes, the person mainly visible after the first camera zoom is the man in the gray Under Armour t-shirt. The camera follows him as he excitedly explores different parts of the house, focusing on his reactions and interactions with the environment, such as sitting on the couch, reaching the counters and sink, and using a broom."
1225-0,"The man of short stature is mainly visible.

**Explanation:**
After the initial wide shot showing the entryway, the camera follows the man of short stature from behind as he runs towards and jumps onto the sofa. His movement and reaction become the central focus of the frame during this sequence."
1225-1,"**Character:** The shorter man (wearing the dark grey t-shirt and black shorts).

**Explanation:** After the initial wide shot showing the characters entering, the camera cuts to follow the shorter man running towards the couch (0:06-0:08). Immediately following this, there is a cut to a closer, static shot (0:08-0:11) that focuses entirely on this man as he sits on the couch and reacts with surprise. He is the sole and prominent subject of this focused shot."
1225-7,C
1225-3,"No, the person mainly visible after the initial scene is not a woman in a red dress. The video primarily focuses on the short friend, who is a man wearing a grey t-shirt and black shorts, as he explores the house."
1229-0,"The object in front of the mirror (a pawn) is different from its reflection (a king) because the pieces were swapped during the process of taking the picture.

Initially, the king piece was placed in front of the mirror. Someone then quickly replaced the king with the pawn before the final photograph was captured. The resulting image shows the pawn in the foreground, but the reflection still shows the king that was present earlier in the setup, creating a photographic trick."
1229-1,"The discrepancy between the object in front of the mirror (pawn) and its reflection (king) is caused by the camera mode used, which captures the image sequentially over time rather than instantaneously.

**Explanation:** The camera mode, likely a panorama or similar motion-capture feature, required the user to move the phone. It first captured the reflection of the king in the mirror. During the capture process, as the phone moved or scanned the scene, the king was physically swapped for the pawn. The camera then captured the pawn directly in front of the mirror. The final image stitches these different moments together, showing the pawn in the foreground and its earlier reflection (the king) in the mirror."
1229-3,"No, the difference between the object and its reflection is not because the mirror is a special type like a concave mirror.

**Explanation:**

Standard mirrors, whether flat, concave, or convex, reflect the actual object placed in front of them (though the image might be distorted, magnified, or minified depending on the mirror type and object distance). They cannot change the fundamental identity of the object being reflected, such as transforming a pawn into a king.

The effect seen in the video, where a pawn is in front of the mirror but the reflection shown *on the phone screen* is a king, is achieved through digital means:

1.  **Augmented Reality (AR):** The phone is likely running an AR application. The app initially saw the king and its reflection. When the king was swapped for the pawn, the app continued to digitally overlay the previously captured image of the king's reflection onto the mirror's surface in the camera feed. The interface elements visible on the phone screen support this.
2.  **Video Editing:** Alternatively, the video could have been edited after filming. The segment showing the pawn could have had the reflection of the king digitally composited onto the mirror area.

In either case, it's a software manipulation creating a visual illusion, not a property of the physical mirror itself."
1229-2,"Yes, the difference between the object and its reflection is due to the use of a guided or panoramic photography feature on the phone.

This type of feature captures the image sequentially by stitching together different parts of the scene recorded at slightly different times as the phone moves. In the video, the king was present when the reflection part of the scene was captured. Then, the piece was quickly swapped for a pawn before the phone captured the area directly in front of the mirror. The final image combines these moments, showing the pawn directly but its earlier reflection (the king) in the mirror."
1229-7,C
1231-0,"The water in the waterfall appears to flow horizontally, not backwards, because the video frame has been intentionally rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. This rotation changes the viewer's perspective, making the natural downward flow of the water appear as if it's moving horizontally across the screen from right to left."
1231-7,D
1231-2,"No, the perceived orientation of the waterfall at the end of the video is not due to reverse video processing.

This is an optical illusion created by filming the reflection of the scene (the man and the waterfall) in the puddle and then rotating the video frame by 90 degrees. The reflection is naturally inverted, and when the frame is rotated, this inverted reflection appears upright relative to the new frame orientation, making the actual scene look inverted or sideways. The water in the waterfall continues to flow downwards in reality, which confirms the video is not playing in reverse."
1231-3,"No, the waterfall does not appear to flow backwards due to digital special effects techniques. The effect is an optical illusion created by filming the reflection of the vertically falling waterfall in a puddle and then rotating the camera's perspective (or the viewer rotating their phone) by 90 degrees. This rotation makes the reflected water appear to flow horizontally across the frame."
1231-1,"The waterfall appears to flow sideways or unnaturally at the end because the phone used to film it was rotated 90 degrees.

**Explanation:** Gravity makes the water fall vertically downwards. However, when the camera is turned sideways, the image captured is also rotated. This rotation changes the frame of reference for the viewer. The downward motion of the water in the real world is now displayed as motion across the horizontal axis of the video frame, making it look like the water is flowing sideways towards what appears to be the side edge (which is actually the ground). This creates an optical illusion because our brain expects gravity to pull things towards the bottom of the screen."
1233-0,"The final photograph shows two reflections because it was taken using the smartphone's panoramic mode while scanning across the puddle's surface.

Here's a brief explanation:
The photographer started the panoramic capture while the man's reflection was visible in the puddle. As the phone moved across the puddle, it sequentially recorded the reflection. Even though the man walked away, his reflection was already captured in the initial part of the panoramic scan. The later part of the scan captured the woman's reflection. The phone's software then stitched these different moments together into the single final image, showing both reflections."
1233-2,"No, the use of the vertical panoramic camera function does not create two reflections.

Instead, it captures and stitches together multiple vertical slices of the scene, including the reflection in the puddle, into one single, continuous, and elongated image. This results in one unified reflection that mirrors the vertically expanded view of the subject and the sky."
1233-1,"The final image was created using the phone's panoramic mode. This mode captures the scene sequentially over time as the camera sweeps across the view.

The man was standing near the puddle when the panoramic capture began, so his reflection was recorded in the initial part of the sweep. He then walked away *while* the panorama was still being captured. The camera continued sweeping and recorded the woman's reflection. The final panoramic image stitches these different moments together, resulting in both reflections being visible even though the man was no longer physically present at the end of the capture."
1233-3,"No, the effect is not primarily due to image synthesis technology in the sense of creating artificial elements.

**Explanation:**

The final image is created using the smartphone's **vertical panorama mode**. Here's how it works:

1.  The photographer starts capturing the panorama with the phone held low, aimed at the puddle. This captures the reflection of the sky and the subjects first.
2.  The photographer then sweeps the phone upwards. As the phone moves up, it captures the actual subjects kneeling/standing above the puddle.
3.  The phone's software stitches these sequentially captured vertical slices together. The portion captured first (the reflection) forms the bottom of the final panoramic image, and the portion captured later (the actual subjects) forms the top.

Therefore, the final image shows both the real scene and its reflection because the panorama mode captured both views sequentially during the upward sweep and combined them. It's a result of the capture technique and standard panorama stitching, not synthesizing a fake reflection."

1235-0,"**47**

**Explanation:**
The pattern in the quiz is to take the larger of the two numbers being added and place the sum of the two numbers next to it.
For 4 + 3:
*   The larger number is 4.
*   The sum is 4 + 3 = 7.
*   Combining the larger number (4) and the sum (7) gives 47."
1235-7,D
1235-3,"No, according to the pattern in the video, 4 + 3 does not equal 412.

**Explanation:** The pattern observed in the video is to concatenate the second number of the addition problem with the sum of the two numbers.
*   2 + 2 = 2 (second number) followed by 4 (sum) = 24
*   3 + 3 = 3 (second number) followed by 6 (sum) = 36
*   4 + 5 = 5 (second number) followed by 9 (sum) = 59

Following this pattern for 4 + 3:
*   The second number is 3.
*   The sum is 4 + 3 = 7.
*   Concatenating these gives 37.

Therefore, based on the established pattern, 4 + 3 = 37, not 412."
1235-2,"Yes, based on the pattern in the video, 4 + 3 equals 37.

**Explanation:** The pattern shown is A + B = (B * 10) + (A + B). In the first three examples:
*   2 + 2 = (2 * 10) + (2 + 2) = 20 + 4 = 24
*   3 + 3 = (3 * 10) + (3 + 3) = 30 + 6 = 36
*   4 + 5 = (5 * 10) + (4 + 5) = 50 + 9 = 59

Applying this pattern to 4 + 3:
*   4 + 3 = (3 * 10) + (4 + 3) = 30 + 7 = 37"
1235-1,"The result of 4 plus 3 according to the pattern is **47**.

**Explanation:**
The pattern observed in the previous examples is to concatenate the larger of the two numbers being added with their sum.
1.  2 + 2 = 24 (Larger number is 2, sum is 4 -> 24)
2.  3 + 3 = 36 (Larger number is 3, sum is 6 -> 36)
3.  4 + 5 = 59 (Larger number is 5, sum is 9 -> 59)
Applying this to 4 + 3:
*   The larger number is 4.

*   Concatenating the larger number (4) and the sum (7) gives 47."
1236-1,"Yes, the method demonstrated in the video effectively yields accurate calculation results for the specific examples shown.

**Explanation:**
The trick works for dividing numbers ending in zero by 5. Removing the trailing zero is equivalent to dividing the number by 10. Multiplying the result by 2 completes the calculation, because dividing by 5 is the same as dividing by 10 and then multiplying by 2 (N ÷ 5 = (N ÷ 10) × 2). For example, 60 ÷ 5 = (60 ÷ 10) × 2 = 6 × 2 = 12."
1236-2,"Yes, the method shown in the video is effective in producing accurate results for the division problems presented.

The trick works because dividing a number by 5 is mathematically equivalent to multiplying that number by 2 and then dividing by 10. In the video, for numbers ending in zero (like 10, 30, 60, 90), crossing out the zero effectively divides the number by 10. Multiplying the remaining digit by 2 completes the equivalent operation, yielding the correct answer. For example, 60 ÷ 5 is the same as (60 / 10) * 2 = 6 * 2 = 12."
1236-0,"Yes, the method is useful and produces the correct calculation result for numbers ending in zero when dividing by 5.

**Explanation:**
Dividing a number by 5 is mathematically equivalent to multiplying that number by 2 and then dividing by 10. The trick shown simplifies this: removing the trailing zero is the same as dividing by 10, and then multiplying the remaining number by 2 completes the equivalent operation, yielding the correct answer. For example, `N0 / 5` becomes `(N * 10) / 5`, which simplifies to `N * 2`. The trick calculates this by removing the 0 (leaving `N`) and then multiplying by 2."
1236-7,C
1236-3,"No, the method shown in the video is not ineffective for the reason stated, because it does not involve squaring the numbers.

The method demonstrated is a shortcut for dividing numbers ending in zero by 5. It involves removing the trailing zero (which is equivalent to dividing by 10) and then multiplying the remaining number by 2. This works because dividing by 5 is mathematically equivalent to multiplying by 2 and then dividing by 10 (or dividing by 10 and then multiplying by 2). The video does not show any squaring operation."
1239-0,"Yes, the method is useful to produce the correct calculation result.

This visual trick accurately generates the 19 times table from 19x1 to 19x10 by combining two sequences: writing the odd numbers from 1 to 19 vertically, and then writing the digits from 9 down to 0 vertically next to them. This correctly produces the sequence 19, 38, 57, 76, 95, 114, 133, 152, 171, 190."
1239-1,"Yes, the method shown helps in achieving accurate calculation results for the 19 times table from 1 to 10.

**Explanation:**
The technique involves writing the first ten odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19) and then appending the digits from 9 down to 0 (9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0) respectively. This combination correctly generates the sequence of multiples: 19, 38, 57, 76, 95, 114, 133, 152, 171, 190, which are the accurate results for 19×1 through 19×10."
1239-2,"Yes, the method is effective in producing correct results for the multiplication table of 19 from 1 to 10.

**Explanation:** The method involves two steps:
1.  Write down the sequential odd numbers starting from 1 (1, 3, 5, ..., 19) for the tens/hundreds place.
2.  Write down the digits descending from 9 to 0 (9, 8, 7, ..., 0) for the units place.

Combining these two sequences generates the correct products: 19, 38, 57, 76, 95, 114, 133, 152, 171, 190, which are the actual results for 19x1 through 19x10."

**Explanation:**

*   **Correctness:** The method works by generating two sequences. The first part of the answer (tens and hundreds digits) follows the sequence of odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19). The second part (units digit) follows the sequence of digits counting down from 9 to 0 (9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0). Combining these correctly yields the multiples 19, 38, 57, ..., 190. This pattern holds because adding 19 is equivalent to adding 20 (increasing the tens digit by 2) and subtracting 1 (decreasing the units digit by 1).
*   **Efficiency:** Compared to performing standard multi-digit multiplication for each line (19x1, 19x2, etc.), this trick can be more efficient *specifically for generating the entire list sequentially*, as it relies on writing two simple, predictable sequences. However, for finding a *single* product (like 19x7) without the rest of the list, standard multiplication or mental math might be faster than generating the sequence up to that point using the trick. Standard multiplication is also a more fundamental and universally applicable skill."
1239-7,B
1237-0,"The answer is 63.

**Explanation:**
The pattern in the video follows the rule: n + n = n * (n - 2).
*   4 + 4 = 4 * (4 - 2) = 4 * 2 = 8
*   5 + 5 = 5 * (5 - 2) = 5 * 3 = 15
*   6 + 6 = 6 * (6 - 2) = 6 * 4 = 24
Applying this pattern to 9 + 9:
*   9 + 9 = 9 * (9 - 2) = 9 * 7 = 63"
1237-7,B
1237-1,"The result of 9 plus 9 according to the pattern is 63.

**Explanation:**

1.  **4 + 4 = 08:** The result is `4 * 2`.
2.  **5 + 5 = 15:** The result is `5 * 3`.
3.  **6 + 6 = 24:** The result is `6 * 4`.

The pattern is `x + x = x * (x - 2)`.
Applying this pattern to `9 + 9`:
`9 + 9 = 9 * (9 - 2) = 9 * 7 = 63`."
1237-3,"No, according to the pattern in the video, 9 + 9 does not equal 72.

**Explanation:**
The pattern established in the video is X + X = X * (X - 2).
*   4 + 4 = 4 * (4 - 2) = 4 * 2 = 8
*   5 + 5 = 5 * (5 - 2) = 5 * 3 = 15
*   6 + 6 = 6 * (6 - 2) = 6 * 4 = 24

Applying this pattern to 9 + 9:
*   9 + 9 = 9 * (9 - 2) = 9 * 7 = 63

Therefore, based on the established pattern, 9 + 9 equals 63, not 72."
1237-2,"Yes, based on the pattern in the video, the equation 9 + 9 results in 63.

**Explanation:**
The pattern observed in the equations is not standard addition. Instead, it follows the rule a * (a - 2):
*   4 * (4 - 2) = 4 * 2 = 8
*   5 * (5 - 2) = 5 * 3 = 15
*   6 * (6 - 2) = 6 * 4 = 24
Applying this pattern to the final equation:
*   9 * (9 - 2) = 9 * 7 = 63"
1242-1,The outcome of the man's magic trick was that he made the rolled-up banknote disappear from under the red cup on the table. The woman then retrieved the banknote from the man's hand (which was holding the cup) and reacted with shock and surprise upon unrolling it.
1242-3,"No, the man's magic trick did not fail for that reason. The object did not remain visible on the table throughout the performance; it was covered by the cup and had disappeared from the table when the man lifted the cup for the final reveal. The trick was successful because the object vanished from its initial position and reappeared in the woman's hand."
1242-0,"**Outcome:** The rolled-up dollar bill disappeared from under the red cup.

**Explanation:** The man repeatedly covered the bill with the cup and lifted it. On the final lift, the bill had vanished from the table. The woman then playfully pretended to pull the bill from the man's ear, revealing it and completing the trick with a humorous twist."
1242-7,C
1242-2,"No, the man's magic trick did not succeed in genuinely surprising the woman. The trick involved making the banknote *disappear* from under the cup, not appear. Furthermore, the woman revealed the banknote herself at the end, indicating she was complicit in the trick and her surprised reaction was part of the performance, not genuine astonishment."
1255-0,"Yellow. The man in the blue t-shirt runs under the parachute immediately after the voice calls out ""Yellow"". He waits through the calls for Red, Pink, and Orange, only running when Yellow is announced."
1255-1,"Yellow.

Explanation: The man in the blue shirt waited while the colors ""Red,"" ""Pink,"" and ""Orange"" were called. He only ran underneath the parachute when ""Yellow"" was announced."
1255-7,A
1255-2,"Yes, the man in the blue t-shirt waited while the colors Red, Pink, and Orange were called. He ran underneath the parachute immediately after the color Yellow was announced."
1255-3,"No, the man in the blue shirt did not run underneath after the color red was called. Another participant ran when ""red"" was called, while the man in the blue shirt remained holding the parachute until the color ""yellow"" was called later in the video."
1260-1,"The man in white does not appear shocked at the conclusion of the video. His reaction after tasting the food is relatively neutral, possibly indicating a higher spice tolerance or amusement at his friend's more dramatic reaction. The ""shocking"" element implied by the text ""WAIT FOR THE END 💀"" likely refers to the meme edits added at the very end or the severe reaction of the man in black, rather than an actual expression of shock from the man in white."
1260-2,"No, the man in white is not surprised because the man in black ate all the food.

His reaction of surprise and discomfort occurs immediately after he takes a bite of the food himself, indicating his reaction is due to the taste or spiciness of the food, not because the other man ate it."
1260-0,"The man in white looks surprised because his companion (the man in black) has an unexpectedly strong and negative reaction to the food they are both eating. Since the man in white didn't react nearly as intensely himself, he is taken aback by the severity of his friend's discomfort."
1260-7,C
1260-3,"No, the man in the white shirt does not appear surprised or negatively affected by the food being spicy.

**Explanation:** His reaction after tasting the food is neutral and calm. He shows no signs of discomfort, grimacing, or needing a napkin, unlike the man in the black shirt who has a strong, immediate negative reaction consistent with finding the food unexpectedly spicy."
1261-0,"The two men holding torches are visible only in the reflection because they were strategically positioned above the mirror, likely near the tree trunk but outside the camera's direct line of sight for the upper portion of the image showing the woman.

The mirror, placed flat on the ground, reflected the scene directly above it – including the underside of the tree canopy and the men with torches – towards the low-angled camera. The camera captured both the direct view of the woman sitting above the mirror and the reflected view of the men within the mirror, creating a layered, composite image as an intentional photographic technique."
1261-2,"No, the presence of the two men in the reflection is not due to the photos being edited together.

The video clearly shows the behind-the-scenes setup where the two men holding torches are physically positioned behind the tree during the photoshoot. The mirror is placed on the ground to capture their reflection along with the tree roots, while the woman reads above. This demonstrates that the effect was achieved through intentional in-camera composition and staging, not by digitally combining separate images later."
1261-1,"The presence of the two men in the reflection is due to the principles of light reflection and the specific positioning of the camera, the mirror, and the subjects.

The mirror, placed flat on the ground, reflects the scene above and in front of it. The camera is positioned very low to the ground, aiming at the mirror. This low angle allows the camera to capture a reflection of not only the woman sitting close to the mirror under the tree but also the two men standing further back and higher up relative to the mirror's plane. Light rays from the men travel to the mirror and reflect off its surface into the camera lens, making them appear in the reflected image alongside the woman and the tree."
1261-3,"No, the reflection of the two men in the final image is likely not created solely by using the mirror placed on the ground.

**Explanation:** In the setup shown, the two men with torches are standing behind the seated person relative to the camera. A flat mirror on the ground would reflect the scene above it. Given the camera's low angle and the men's position, their reflection in a simple flat mirror would appear higher up in the reflected scene (likely above or behind the reflection of the seated person), not below the reflected base of the tree as depicted in the final artistic image. The final image appears to be a composite or digitally manipulated to achieve this specific composition."

1262-1,"The girl in the pink top felt distressed and upset after grabbing the performer's arm. This is shown by her immediately bursting into loud tears and repeatedly calling out ""Daddy!"" after the interaction."
1262-3,"No, the girl in the pink top did not feel curious and amused after she held the performer's arm. Her immediate reaction was to start crying loudly, indicating she felt distressed or frightened by the interaction."
1262-0,"The girl in the pink top appears **distressed and upset**.

After pulling on the performer's hands and seeing him remain completely still, she immediately starts crying loudly and calls out for her father (""Daddy!""), indicating she is experiencing significant emotional distress, possibly mixed with fear or confusion about the lack of reaction or the belief she might have caused harm."
1262-2,"Yes, the girl in the pink top appeared worried and scared after she held and pulled the performer's arm/hands.

**Explanation:**
Immediately after pulling on the performer's clasped hands, the girl's demeanor changes from curious to distressed. She begins to cry loudly, her face shows clear signs of upset, and she repeatedly calls out ""Daddy!"", indicating she felt scared and possibly believed she had caused harm or broken the ""statue."""

1275-2,"Yes, the person in the blue T-shirt lost the challenge. The challenge involved adding water to an already full glass, relying on surface tension to keep it from spilling. The man in the blue T-shirt was the one whose turn resulted in the surface tension breaking and the water overflowing from the glass. The other participants successfully added water during their turns without causing a spill."
1275-3,"No, the person in the blue shirt did not win the challenge. His drop was the one that broke the surface tension of the water, causing it to spill over the rim of the glass, which signifies losing in this type of game."
1275-0,"**Winner:** The man in the blue shirt.

**Reason:** He was the last participant to successfully add water to the glass, utilizing surface tension to keep the water level above the rim without spilling. The participant immediately following him (in the purple shirt) caused the water to spill, thus ending the challenge and making the blue-shirted man the winner of that round."
1275-1,"The winner of the challenge is the participant wearing the **red shirt**.

**Explanation:** He was the last person to successfully add drops of water to the glass (around 0:41-0:45), maintaining the dome of water above the rim due to surface tension. The participant in the blue shirt took the next turn (0:47-0:50) and caused the water to spill, thus ending the game and making the red shirt participant the winner."
1275-7,D
1276-2,"No, the lemon icons at the top of the video do not represent different sizes of lemons.

Explanation: The video shows four lemon icons above the participants. While checkmarks appear on these icons sequentially as participants eat progressively larger lemon candies, the icons themselves remain the same size throughout the video. The increasing size is demonstrated by the actual candies being eaten, not by the icons."
1276-0,"The lemon icons at the top of the video represent the participants or stages in this sequential candy-eating challenge. A green checkmark appears over an icon after each person successfully finishes eating their lemon candy, visually tracking the progress through the participants from left to right."
1276-3,"No, the lemon icons at the top of the video do not indicate the level of sourness.

The icons function as a progress tracker for the challenge. As each participant eats their lemon candy and completes their turn, a checkmark appears over one of the lemon icons, indicating the sequential completion of the challenge stages."
1276-1,"The lemon icons at the top of the video serve as a **visual progress tracker** for the eating challenge.

**Explanation:** Each lemon icon likely represents a stage in the challenge, corresponding to one participant eating a specific size of the lemon candy. As each person successfully completes their turn (eating their candy), a green checkmark appears over their corresponding lemon icon, indicating that stage of the challenge is finished and visually showing the progression towards completing all stages."

1283-0,"The runner in the red uniform with bib number 23 runs the fastest.

**Explanation:** This runner gets a very quick start and immediately pulls ahead of the other racers, maintaining a clear lead throughout the portion of the race shown in the video."
1283-1,"The fastest runner at the conclusion of the video is the child wearing number 237 in the red/maroon uniform. This runner got an explosive start and established a clear, dominant lead early in the race, being significantly ahead of all other competitors when the video ends."
1283-2,"Yes, the child in the red outfit in the middle lane (Lane 3) is the fastest at the end of the video clip. The video shows this runner getting a strong start, quickly establishing a lead, and maintaining that lead comfortably throughout the duration of the clip."
1283-3,"**Answer:** No, the child in the green outfit is not the fastest runner at the end of the video.

**Explanation:** Shortly after the race starts (around 0:12-0:14), the runner in the red/maroon outfit with bib number 237 takes a significant lead over all other competitors. The child in green, running in the leftmost lane, is visibly slower than the lead runner and is positioned towards the back of the group as they head into the turn."
1283-7,C
1278-3,"Yes, the difference in the number of attempts between the first two challenges is more than two.

The video indicates the first challenge took ""16 hours"" of practice, implying a very large number of attempts were made before success. The second challenge is explicitly labeled ""First try,"" meaning it took only 1 attempt. The difference between the many attempts implied by ""16 hours"" and the single attempt of the ""First try"" is certainly greater than two attempts."
1278-0,"The first challenge, indicated by ""16 hours"", implies it took numerous attempts over that duration to succeed. The second challenge explicitly states it was achieved on the ""First try"", meaning only one attempt was made.

Therefore, the difference is that the first challenge required a large, unspecified number of attempts, significantly more than the single attempt needed for the second challenge."
1278-2,"**No.**

The video indicates the first challenge took ""16 hours"" to complete, which refers to the duration, not the number of attempts. The second challenge explicitly states it was achieved on the ""First try,"" meaning 1 attempt. Since the number of attempts for the first challenge is unknown, we cannot determine if the difference in attempts between the two challenges is exactly one."
1278-7,D
1278-1,"The second challenge was completed on the ""First try,"" meaning it took exactly 1 attempt.

The first challenge is labeled ""16 hours,"" which indicates the time spent practicing or attempting the trick before achieving the success shown. While the exact number of attempts isn't stated, the 16-hour duration strongly implies it took numerous attempts.

Therefore, although we know the second challenge took 1 attempt, we cannot determine the exact numerical difference because the specific number of attempts for the first challenge (over 16 hours) is unknown, other than it being significantly more than one."
1288-3,"Yes, the blond man does appear playful and energetic at the end of the video. After briefly looking surprised when the woman turns around, he immediately resumes his pose with the towel and sticks, looking towards the camera with a mischievous and energetic expression right before the video cuts off."
1288-1,"The blond man appears playfully caught or ""busted."" His grimace and wide eyes suggest a comedic, exaggerated fear or anticipation of the woman's reaction after he deliberately poked her to get her attention while she was looking at her phone."
1288-2,"No, the man's frustration appears to be performative and part of a comedic act. His exaggerated facial expression, pointing gesture, and the accompanying sound effect suggest the reaction is staged for humor within the context of the skit, rather than genuine annoyance at the woman revealing the trick."
1288-7,D
1288-0,"The blond man appears **embarrassed** or **awkward** at the end of the video.

**Explanation:** He was playfully pretending to use magic with the towel, but accidentally hit the woman with a stick hidden behind it. Her startled and possibly annoyed reaction causes his playful demeanor to vanish, replaced by an awkward grimace, indicating embarrassment or feeling caught out by his actions backfiring."
1290-0,"The man reacts with shock and surprise.

His eyes widen significantly and his mouth drops open as he watches the pillow fly high into the air, suggesting he threw it much harder or higher than he anticipated and is startled by the result."
1290-2,"Yes, the man shows clear signs of shock, but not pain. His wide eyes and open mouth are classic indicators of surprise or shock at the pillow's trajectory after he threw it, rather than a reaction to physical discomfort."
1290-1,The man reacts with shock and surprise. This is evident as he looks upwards towards the ascending pillow with wide eyes and an open mouth.
1290-3,"No, the man at the end does not seem amused or entertained.

**Explanation:** His facial expression, characterized by wide-open eyes and an open mouth as he looks up after the pillow, indicates surprise or shock rather than amusement. These features are typically associated with astonishment at an unexpected event, not enjoyment or entertainment, which would more likely involve smiling or laughter. He appears taken aback by how the pillow flew after his attempt."
1290-7,C
1293-0,"The bottle cap appears to fly because it was suspended in mid-air using a thin wire or string hanging from above, which is visible during the setup phase in the video. This practical effect holds the cap stationary for the photograph."
1293-2,"Yes, the bottle cap in the second scene was made to look like it was flying using a thin string and clever camera angles.

The video clearly shows the setup where the bottle cap is suspended from a thin string. The photographer then positions the camera at a low angle, looking upwards. Additionally, water is sprayed into the scene to create droplets, enhancing the dynamic effect in the final photograph where the cap appears to float amidst the splashes."
1293-1,"The bottle cap was suspended using a thin string or wire. An assistant held this string from above, positioning the cap in mid-air between the camera and the model, while another person sprayed water to create the effect of droplets around the cap for the photograph."
1293-7,D
1293-3,"No, the bottle cap did not fly because someone flicked it. The video clearly shows the setup where the bottle cap is suspended in the air by a thin string, and water is being sprayed towards it to create the effect of droplets around a seemingly floating cap for the photograph."
1294-2,"**No.**

The video shows two separate clips edited together. The first clip features a man slicing a large piece of cured meat (dark red, firm) in a hot air balloon. The second clip shows a chef placing a raw, fresh steak (brighter red, marbled) onto a grill alongside corn. The type of meat is distinctly different in each scene, and there is no visual connection suggesting the steak fell from the balloon onto the grill."
1294-1,The piece of meat ended up on the grill because someone off-screen threw it onto the cooking surface while the chef was briefly turned away.
1294-0,"Based on the narrative presented in the video, the piece of meat appeared on the grill suddenly while the chef was briefly turned away after placing the corn.

*Explanation:* The video uses a common technique, likely video editing (a jump cut) or staging with an off-camera assistant, to create a moment of surprise or humor. The chef places the corn, turns his back, and upon turning around, the steak is unexpectedly present, leading to his surprised reaction. The narrative doesn't provide an in-universe explanation; the appearance itself *is* the event, designed to be abrupt and unexpected for comedic effect."
1294-3,"**No.**

The video shows the chef carefully placing pieces of corn on the grill using tongs. However, the steak appears suddenly on the grill while the chef is turned away. The way the steak lands suggests it was dropped or thrown onto the grill, not carefully placed with tongs like the corn was."
1294-7,D
1298-1,"The man's football did not come back to him because it failed to rebound effectively off the wall.

**Explanation:** Unlike the other ball thrown, which bounced back strongly, the man's ball hit the wall and dropped almost straight down. This indicates that his ball likely lacked sufficient elasticity or internal air pressure (was underinflated). A properly inflated, elastic ball stores energy upon impact and releases it to push off the surface (rebound), as described by principles like restitution and elastic collisions. The man's ball absorbed the impact energy rather than reflecting it, preventing a significant bounce back towards him."
1298-3,"No, the football did return towards the players after bouncing off the wall. There is no dog visible in the video, and thus no dog intercepted the ball or prevented its return."
1298-2,"No. The video shows the man's football hitting the wall, bouncing off it, and rolling back on the ground towards him. It did not land in the blue bucket."
1298-0,"The video clip ends immediately after the man throws the football. It cuts off before the ball has time to hit the wall and potentially bounce back, so the outcome of the throw is not shown."
1298-7,C
1299-7,A
1299-2,"Yes, the elevator door likely closed automatically because its preset hold-open timer expired. Elevators typically have a maximum time they will stay open, even if the 'door open' button is being pressed, to ensure efficiency and prevent indefinite holding; this timer appears to have run out, initiating the closing sequence despite the person's attempts to keep it open."
1299-1,"The elevator door shut because the **Maximum Hold Time was Exceeded**.

**Explanation:** Elevators are programmed with a maximum time limit for how long the doors can be held open using the ""door open"" button. This prevents the elevator from being held indefinitely and ensures it remains available for other passengers. Even though the person was pressing the button, this built-in timer expired, causing the system to override the command and close the doors."
1299-3,"No. The video shows the woman repeatedly pressing the 'door open' button in an attempt to hold the elevator for the person running towards it. Her surprised reaction when the door begins to close indicates that the closure was automatic, likely due to the elevator's timer, and not a result of her intentionally pressing the 'close door' button."
1299-0,"**Answer:** The elevator door closed because the person inside removed their hand, which was physically holding it open.

**Explanation:** The video shows the person inside the elevator initially using their hand to keep the door from shutting. Once they moved their hand away from the door's edge, the elevator's automatic closing mechanism engaged, causing the door to close as it normally would when unobstructed."
1307-3,"No, the tire that takes the lead at the start does not remain in the lead all the time. Shortly after starting, a smaller tire catches up, and the two tires roll down the hill side-by-side or with their positions fluctuating."
1307-2,"No, the tire initially lagging behind (the smaller one) does not surpass the leading tire (the larger one) after the ramp. The video shows that after both tires miss the ramp, the larger tire continues to roll faster and maintains its lead over the smaller tire down the hill."
1307-0,"Past the ramp, the smaller tire appears to maintain or slightly increase its speed relative to the larger tire.

**Explanation:** While both tires continue downhill after the ramp, the larger tire experiences more significant bouncing. This bouncing likely converts some of its forward momentum into vertical movement and causes greater interaction with the uneven terrain, reducing its average forward speed compared to the smaller tire, which maintains a more consistent roll. Consequently, the speed difference between the two either decreases or shifts slightly in favor of the smaller tire as they travel further down the hill."
1307-7,C
1307-1,"The speed difference between the large tire and the small tire increases as they move forward past the ramp.

**Explanation:** The large tire overtakes the smaller tire well before reaching the ramp's location. As both tires continue rolling downhill past the ramp, the large tire maintains a higher velocity and continues to pull further ahead of the smaller tire, visibly increasing the distance between them. This widening gap indicates that the large tire's speed advantage over the small tire is growing, meaning their speed difference is increasing."
1308-1,The speed of the black missile remains constant throughout its appearance in the animation. There is no visual indication that it accelerates or decelerates during its flight path shown.
1308-0,"The speed of the black missile increases significantly during the animation. It is shown accelerating rapidly, overtaking the bullet and pulling away at an increasing rate, indicating a substantial increase in its velocity compared to the bullet's relatively constant speed."
1308-7,A
1308-3,"No, the speed of the black missile in the animation does not appear to keep increasing. The animation depicts the missile moving at a very high, but visually constant, velocity to contrast it with the bullet's speed. There are no visual cues, like increasing background blur or a rapidly growing exhaust trail, to suggest acceleration during the time it is shown."
1308-2,"No, the black missile in the animation does not decelerate to match the bullet's speed. The animation depicts the black missile appearing on screen already traveling at a significantly higher velocity than the bullet and immediately overtaking it, without any visual indication of slowing down first."
1310-2,"No, Michiel did not complete the game faster than Celine. Celine placed her final ball into her hoop just before Michiel placed his last ball into his hoop."
1310-0,"Both players finished at the same time.

**Explanation:** The video shows both the man and the woman placing their final ball into their respective hoops simultaneously at the end of the game."
1310-1,"Based on the video, neither participant finished the game in a shorter amount of time. Both the woman and the man appear to collect and deposit their fifth ball simultaneously, with the on-screen score counters updating to five balls for both players at the exact same moment."
1310-7,B
1310-3,"No, Celine Michiel did not finish the game faster. The video shows the man completing the task of collecting his balls and placing them in the hoop slightly before Celine finishes hers. Her reaction at the end also indicates she did not win. The soccer ball icons appear to track the number of balls Celine collected, not her speed relative to her opponent or the outcome of the race."
1318-0,"The daughter appears unimpressed and possibly slightly annoyed or exasperated at the end.

**Explanation:** Her facial expression is neutral, lacking any amusement or smile. She leans back against the sofa and looks away from her dad, suggesting she is not engaged or entertained by his cat imitation and may be slightly irritated or resigned to his antics instead of getting a direct answer to her question."
1318-1,"The daughter appears unimpressed and possibly disappointed at the conclusion of the video. Her expression remains neutral and deadpan throughout her dad's cat impersonation, showing no amusement or positive reaction to his antics, suggesting she is not happy with this substitute for a real cat."
1318-3,"No, the daughter does not appear amused or entertained by her father's antics at the end. Her facial expression remains neutral and she is not smiling or laughing, suggesting she is unimpressed or indifferent to his cat impersonation."
1318-2,"No, the daughter does not seem speechless. She looks away from her father with an expression that appears more unimpressed, resigned, or slightly annoyed rather than shocked or amazed into silence."
1318-7,A
1312-0,"Yes, the treadmill is running while the person in the video is sleeping. This is evident because the person slides backward along the treadmill belt, indicating the belt is in motion underneath them."
1312-1,"Yes, the treadmill was active while the person was trying to sleep. The video shows the person sliding backward on the moving belt and using their arms to push themselves forward to stay in place."
1312-2,"Yes, the person in the video had to repeatedly push forward with their arms to avoid falling off the back of the treadmill. This was necessary because the treadmill belt was moving backward beneath them while they were lying down in the ""Sleeping"" segment."
1312-3,"No, the treadmill belt was not stationary while the person was sleeping.

**Explanation:** The person is visibly sliding backward along the treadmill belt, indicating that the belt was moving underneath them."
1312-7,C
1321-1,"The girl with braids appears **happy and friendly** at the conclusion of the video.

**Explanation:** She turns her head towards the person filming and offers a clear, direct smile, suggesting she is pleasantly aware of being noticed or filmed and is responding in a positive and engaging manner."
1321-0,"The girl in braids appears **interested and pleased**.

**Explanation:** Her eyes are focused towards the right (where the man pointed and others are looking), indicating interest and attention towards an event happening off-screen. Additionally, she has a subtle, gentle smile, suggesting she is pleased or enjoying what she is observing."
1321-7,A
1321-3,"Yes, the girl with braids appears happy at the end of the video.
Explanation: In the final moments of the clip, she turns slightly towards the camera and has a clear smile on her face."
1321-2,"No, the girl with braids does not appear dazed or confused. She is looking up in the direction the man is pointing, with a slight smile and an attentive expression, suggesting she is engaged and interested in what he is showing her or what is happening above the crowd."
1324-2,"Yes, both the man and the woman experience shock at the end of the video. After the man takes the dog from the woman, a cracking sound effect plays as he handles it. Immediately following the sound, both individuals display wide eyes and open mouths, indicating a clear reaction of shock and horror to the implication that the dog was ""broken"" like the apple and toilet paper roll shown earlier."
1324-1,"At the conclusion of the video, both the man and the woman appear shocked or surprised.

This shared emotion is caused the instant the woman places the small white dog into the man's arms, which coincides with an abrupt, loud sound effect cutting off the background music. Their wide eyes and open mouths indicate a sudden, unexpected reaction to this specific transfer, contrasting with their calm exchange of previous items (apple, toilet paper, water)."
1324-3,"Yes, the man and woman appear to be in a light-hearted and playful mood at the end of the video.

Their synchronized, exaggerated expressions of shock when the dog is introduced seem intentionally comedic rather than genuinely alarmed. This reaction serves as a humorous punchline to their preceding pattern of mimicking actions with inanimate objects, suggesting the entire interaction, including the surprise ending with the dog, is part of a playful gag."

1324-0,"The mood of both the man and woman at the end of the video is one of **shock and apprehension**.

This is caused by the sequence of events preceding the final moment. The man has just demonstrated a pattern of splitting various objects handed to him (an apple, a roll of toilet paper, and even a glass of water) cleanly in half with a stoic expression. When the woman hands him a small, living dog, the established pattern creates an immediate, alarming implication that he might instinctively do the same to the dog. His shocked expression shows his sudden realization of this absurdity or potential danger, while her apprehensive look reflects her worry about his reaction and the dog's safety after setting up this pattern."
1329-0,"The woman's mood appears to be one of **playful annoyance** or **mock anger**.

**Explanation:** She abruptly breaks her calm yoga pose to chase the man the moment he sits down to relax. His immediate reaction is to flee, suggesting they are engaging in a familiar, lighthearted dynamic rather than a serious conflict. The chase seems like a playful reprimand or a game, possibly because he interrupted her quiet time or relaxed while she was occupied."

1329-3,"No, the woman's mood does not appear to be one of confusion or curiosity.

Her reaction is immediate and energetic; she quickly abandons her yoga pose and runs directly towards the man as soon as he sits down. This swift, purposeful action suggests playfulness or excitement, likely an eagerness to interact with him during his brief moment of rest, rather than a lack of understanding about why he sat down. Confusion would more likely result in hesitation, observation, or a questioning gesture."
1329-1,"The woman appears playfully exasperated or annoyed at the conclusion of the video.

This mood is caused by the man interrupting her stretching session. He places the child down near the couch and immediately sits down himself, seemingly ending his brief turn caring for the child (""King of a few seconds"") and leaving the responsibility with her while he relaxes. Her quick reaction and pursuit suggest mock indignation or frustration at the swift handover."
1329-2,"No, the woman's mood at the end of the video does not reflect genuine frustration or anger.

**Explanation:** Her reaction appears to be one of **playful annoyance**. This is suggested by the speed and nature of her chase, which seems lighthearted rather than aggressive, and strongly supported by the video's caption ""King of a few seconds 😊❤️"". The emojis indicate amusement and affection, framing the interaction as a humorous and relatable moment where his brief relaxation is playfully interrupted, rather than a display of actual anger."
1344-3,"No, the smile is likely not *solely* or *directly* due to being comforted, although comfort plays a role.

**Explanation:** The video shows the baby crying immediately after the injection due to pain. The crying stops quickly once the pain subsides. The baby then appears confused before breaking into a smile, seemingly triggered by the relief that the painful event is over and potentially by the subsequent positive interaction (like being bounced) with the smiling adult. While the constant comforting hold undoubtedly helped the baby feel secure and regulate the distress faster, the smile itself seems more directly related to the cessation of pain and the ensuing interaction, rather than just the passive state of being comforted. It's likely a combination of factors: pain relief, the security of the hold, the baby's temperament, and the positive engagement afterward."
1344-1,"The child smiles after the adult holding them begins to playfully bounce and jiggle them.

**Explanation:** After the initial shock and crying from the injection, the baby pauses, seemingly confused. The adult then initiates a gentle, playful bouncing motion. This sudden shift from the discomfort of the injection to a fun, physical interaction serves as a distraction and changes the baby's emotional state, causing them to smile and laugh."
1344-0,"The child smiles after the injection primarily because the painful stimulus stopped, and the caregiver immediately provided comfort and distraction.

**Brief Explanation:**

1.  **Pain Cessation:** The sharp pain from the injection was brief. Once it ended, the primary cause of distress was removed.
2.  **Comfort and Security:** The baby was held securely by a trusted adult throughout the process, providing a constant sense of safety.
3.  **Distraction and Positive Interaction:** The caregiver quickly shifted the baby's focus away from the residual discomfort by initiating playful bouncing and smiling. This positive social cue and engaging activity captured the baby's attention, leading to a rapid emotional shift from distress to amusement and happiness."
1344-2,"No, the child's smile is not solely because the pain subsides.

**Explanation:** While the crying stops immediately after the needle is removed (indicating the crying was due to pain), there is a noticeable pause where the baby looks calm but teary and slightly confused. The smiling and subsequent laughter begin only *after* the parent starts gently bouncing the baby. This suggests that while the pain relief allows the baby to calm down, the positive emotional response (smiling/laughing) is more directly triggered by the comforting and distracting physical interaction with the parent."
