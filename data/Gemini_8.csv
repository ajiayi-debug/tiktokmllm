0008-0,"The first two people only tap the top of the bottle cap (one with an object, one with a finger), and the cap remains on.

In contrast, the last person performs a sequence of actions: tapping the top of the cap with a chopstick, waving his hand over it, tapping the side of the bottle near the bottom with his knuckles, and waving his hand over it again. This multi-step process, which includes tapping the side/bottom of the bottle unlike the first two, results in the cap popping off."
