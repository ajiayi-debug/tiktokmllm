The targets vary and include: a copper bell, an egg, a lit candle (extinguishing the flame), a red balloon (popping it), another egg, a golf ball on a tee, a glass of Guinness (spilling it), a lightbulb (breaking it), a Terry's Chocolate Orange, another egg, and finally another golf ball on a tee. In all eleven instances shown, the golfer successfully hits the target.",
