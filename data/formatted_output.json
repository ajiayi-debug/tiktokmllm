    "youtube_url": "https://www.youtube.com/shorts/sj81PWrerDk",
    "context": [
      "The video shows three different people interacting with capped glass bottles",
      "The first person, a man with a beard, taps the top of a beer bottle with a small object",
      "The second person, a woman in an Adidas sweatshirt, taps the top of a Corona beer bottle with her finger",
      "In both these instances, the bottle cap remains securely on the bottle",
      "The third person, a man in a black shirt, first taps the top of a Coca-Cola bottle with a chopstick, then waves his hand over it, then taps the side of the bottle near the bottom with his knuckles, and finally waves his hand over the top again",
      "After the final hand wave, the bottle cap pops off, and the soda fizzes"
    ],
    "video_id": "sj81PWrerDk",
    "corrected_question": "How do the actions performed by the man in the black shirt differ from those of the man with the beard and the woman in the Adidas sweatshirt, and how do these differences affect the bottles?\n\nExplanation: The context shows that the first two people only tapped the top of the bottle (on the cap), leaving the cap in place. In contrast, the man in the black shirt not only tapped the top but also waved his hand, tapped the side near the bottom, and waved his hand again—actions that ended up dislodging the cap and causing the soda to fizz."
