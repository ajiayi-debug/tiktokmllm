0008-0,"**Outcome:** The first two people tap the bottle cap, but it remains closed; the last person performs an action (tapping followed by a hand gesture), and the top of the bottle breaks off.

*   **Explanation:** The fundamental difference lies in the result of their actions. The first two individuals attempt a technique that fails, leaving the bottle unchanged. The last person performs an initial similar action which fails, followed by a distinct hand gesture, resulting in the bottle neck breaking cleanly below the cap, effectively 'opening' it in a destructive and likely staged manner."
0008-1,"The actions of the last person differ significantly in the method used to open the bottle. While the first two individuals rely solely on repeatedly tapping the bottle cap's edge with an object until the physical force pops it off, the last person performs only a few initial taps, stops, and then uses a hand gesture over the cap, after which it comes off.

*   *Explanation:* The core difference is the final action seemingly causing the cap to release. The first two use direct, continuous physical force via tapping. The last person switches from brief tapping to a non-contact hand gesture, suggesting an illusion, trick, or pre-prepared setup rather than achieving the result solely through the demonstrated physical tapping."
0008-2,"**Yes**, the last person opened the bottle without using a knife. He tapped the cap with a stick-like object and then flicked the cap off with his finger."
0008-3,"No, the last person in the video did not open the bottle with a knife. While the first two people did fail in their attempts to open their bottles by tapping the cap, the last person used a chopstick, not a knife. Furthermore, the way the cap came off suggests it was likely a trick or the bottle was prepared beforehand, rather than being genuinely opened by the chopstick tap."

0012-0,"There are four robot figures shown in the video. They are seen standing together on display, each with a distinct design and color scheme (white/blue, silver/grey, black/silver, and red/gold)."
0012-1,"**Four robot figures.**

The video initially shows one robot figure walking. Later, it shows a group shot where four distinct robot figures are standing together on display."
0012-2,"Yes, the video displays four robot figures in total.

**Explanation:**
The video first shows one robot walking. Later, it pans across a display featuring that same robot standing alongside three other distinct robot figures, bringing the total count to four."
0012-3,"No, there are more than two robot figures shown in the video. While the video initially focuses on one robot walking, later scenes show at least four distinct robot figures standing together on a stage in front of an ""EX ROBOT"" backdrop."

0016-0,"**Answer:** The person can be perceived as facing either **forward** (towards the viewer) or to the **right** (in profile).

**Explanation:** The image is an optical illusion. Depending on which features the viewer focuses on (e.g., interpreting the central shape as an eye looking forward vs. the right edge as a nose in profile), the perceived direction changes."
0016-1,"The person in the image appears to be looking in two directions simultaneously: **forward and to the right.**

**Explanation:** This is an optical illusion. If you focus on the eye, the person seems to be looking directly forward at the viewer. However, if you focus on the overall shape of the face, particularly the nose, lips, chin, and ear, it forms a clear profile of a person looking towards the right side of the image. The illusion cleverly combines features from both perspectives."
0016-2,"Yes, the person appears to be facing both sideways and forward simultaneously, but this effect is primarily an optical illusion, likely created or enhanced using photo editing techniques.

**Explanation:**

The image is a type of optical illusion where ambiguous features can be interpreted by the brain in multiple ways. One interpretation sees a face looking directly forward (notice the eye, nostril, and lip shape). Another interpretation sees a face in profile looking towards the right (notice the outline of the forehead, nose, lips, and chin). Photo editing tools would likely have been used to carefully craft or combine features to create this specific ambiguous composition that triggers the dual perception in the viewer's brain. The *effect* itself happens in the viewer's perception, but the *stimulus* (the image) was probably made using editing."
0016-3,"Yes, the apparent symmetry of the shoulders contributes significantly to the perception that the person is facing forward. This symmetry provides a visual cue consistent with a frontal or near-frontal pose, helping the brain construct that interpretation as one possibility within this ambiguous optical illusion, alongside the profile view which is suggested by other features."

0036-0,"The machine can cut the zucchini so thinly due to a combination of factors, primarily:

1.  **Controlled Feed Rate:** The machine advances the zucchini towards the blade at a very slow, precise, and consistent rate. The thinness of the slice is determined more by this slow advancement per blade rotation than by the absolute speed of the blade itself.
2.  **Blade Sharpness:** The blade is exceptionally sharp, allowing it to slice cleanly through the zucchini with minimal force and resistance, even without extremely high rotational speed.
3.  **Sufficient Blade Speed:** While it might *appear* slow, the actual speed of the blade's cutting edge is sufficient for the task, especially when combined with the sharpness and controlled feed. The perception of slowness could also be influenced by video frame rates or the blade's diameter."
0036-1,"The thinness of the slices is primarily determined by the **controlled feed rate** of the zucchini relative to the speed and number of blades on the rotating disc.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Slow Feed:** The green conveyor belt pushes the zucchini towards the blades at a very slow and precise speed.
2.  **Multiple Blades:** The rotating disc has multiple sharp blades (often three or more). Even if the disc's rotation speed (RPM) seems moderate, the *frequency* at which a blade passes the zucchini is higher because there are multiple cutting edges per revolution.
3.  **Synchronization:** The machine is designed so that only a very small amount of the zucchini is advanced forward by the conveyor belt in the time it takes for the next blade to come around and make a cut. This small advancement distance directly translates into a thin slice.

Essentially, the slice thickness isn't just about how fast the blades spin, but about how little the vegetable moves forward between each cut."
0036-2,"**No**, that is incorrect.

The thinness of the zucchini slices is determined by the **mechanical design and settings** of the slicing machine, specifically the gap or distance set between the cutting blade and the surface guiding the zucchini, or the rate at which the zucchini is fed into the blade. The high speed of the blades ensures a clean and efficient cut, but it does not determine the thickness.

A **stroboscopic effect** is an optical illusion related to how motion is perceived or recorded (like in a video) when an object moves rapidly relative to the frame rate or frequency of light; it does not affect the physical interaction between the blade and the vegetable."
0036-3,"Yes, the sharpness of the blade is the critical factor that allows the machine to cut the zucchini into thin slices. A sharp edge cleanly severs the vegetable fibers with minimal resistance, which is necessary for producing thin, uniform cuts as shown in the video. While the machine operates at a certain speed, the blade's sharpness is the fundamental property enabling this level of precision."

0037-0,"There are 8 parts of the video that have been artificially edited.

These edits include unnatural movements of the cup (tipping and spinning), the ping pong ball defying gravity (hovering and multiplying), the man's appearance changing (pixelating, changing texture, duplicating), and the appearance of digital elements (""ERROR"" text). These effects were added to simulate common video game glitches."
0037-1,"The video shows signs of artificial editing in **7 distinct sections**:

1.  **Text Overlay:** The initial text ""Video Game glitches be like..."" is an edited overlay.
2.  **Cup Jittering:** The red cup unnaturally vibrates (0:01-0:05), indicating manipulated object physics.
3.  **Ball Freeze & T-Pose:** The ping pong ball freezes mid-air, and the person snaps into a T-pose (0:05-0:08), defying physics and normal movement.
4.  **Low-Poly Models & Clipping:** The person and cup transform into low-polygon models, and the ball clips through the cup (0:08-0:11), simulating rendering and collision glitches.
5.  **Missing Texture & Error Text:** The person's texture changes to a missing texture pattern, and ""ERROR"" text appears (0:11-0:12), simulating graphical errors.
6.  **Duplication & Multiple Balls:** A duplicate of the person appears, and multiple balls spawn with chaotic physics (0:13-0:19), simulating duplication and physics engine glitches.
7.  **Audio Glitches:** Throughout the video, the audio is intentionally distorted and stuttered to mimic game audio glitches."
0037-2,"Yes, the video is edited in multiple parts to create the effect of video game glitches.

The visual effects shown, such as the man transforming into a low-polygon model, displaying a missing texture pattern, the appearance of a duplicate T-posing figure, the unnatural jittering of the cup, the sudden appearance of ""ERROR"" text, and the multiplication of ping pong balls, are not possible through practical means alone and require digital editing and visual effects techniques applied in post-production."
0037-3,"No, the video is not edited only in one part. Multiple distinct glitch effects are applied sequentially throughout the video, including the cup clipping through the counter, the person T-posing, the person's texture changing, a duplicate character appearing, and multiple balls spawning, indicating that editing occurred in several different segments."
0037-7,A
0038-0,"The last person was likely able to snap off the cap so easily because **the cap was pre-loosened or modified beforehand.**

**Explanation:** The first two individuals attempt to remove the cap by tapping it, without success. The final person performs similar taps followed by a hand gesture, and the cap comes off effortlessly. This contrast strongly suggests the cap's integrity was compromised before the final attempt, making it easy to remove for the video, likely as a trick or staged demonstration."
0038-1,"The bottle cap broke off easily because it was pre-cut or scored almost all the way through before filming. This preparation weakened the metal significantly, allowing it to be snapped off with minimal force, such as a light tap, while the hand gesture served as misdirection."
0038-2,"**Yes**, the last person successfully broke the bottle. Their action of striking the top of the bottle caused the bottom to cleanly break off due to the force transmitted through the liquid."
0038-3,"**No**: The last person did not use the object (which appears to be a piece of paper or tissue, not necessarily a lighter) as a lever. They tapped the top of the bottle cap a few times, then moved the object away and made a hand gesture, after which the cap came off. This action does not involve positioning the object under the cap's edge and applying force to pry it off, which is characteristic of using it as a lever."
0038-7,C
0064-0,"The room went dark because the lamp inside the room, which was the only light source shown, turned off at the exact moment the stick figure closed the door.

This happens not because closing the door physically affected the lamp, but as an intentional animation choice by the creator. The timing is used for comedic and suspenseful effect, subverting the expectation of safety after closing the door and immediately setting up the scare that follows in the dark."
0064-1,"The room became dark because the only source of light shown inside the room, a lamp sitting on a dresser, turned off immediately after the stick figure character shut the door."
0064-2,"**No**, the room went dark because the stick figure character closed the door, but this caused the lamp to **turn off**, not fall. The impact from the door slam made the lamp wobble and extinguish, plunging the room into darkness."
0064-3,"No, the room did not go dark because the character accidentally hit the light switch when closing the door.

The character intentionally hit the light switch in the hallway, turning off the hallway light *before* running into the bedroom. After closing the bedroom door, the lamp inside the bedroom went out separately."
0064-7,A
0070-0,"The person in the video poured the water two times. He poured water initially from the green mug, paused after a brief moment, and then resumed pouring water into the black mug a second time."
0070-1,"The person pours water **two** times in the video.

*   **Explanation:** The person starts pouring water from the green mug into the black mug, stops briefly while reacting with surprise and then thoughtfulness (indicated by the overlayed images and sound), and then resumes pouring water into the black mug a second time."
0070-2,"Yes, the person in the video poured the water twice.

**Explanation:** The video shows the person starting to pour water from the green mug into the black mug. They pause briefly while reacting to images appearing above their head, and then they resume pouring the water into the black mug, making it two separate pouring actions."
0070-3,"No, the person in the video did not pour the water only once. They started pouring, paused while looking surprised and thinking, and then resumed pouring the water from the green M&M mug into the black gun-shaped mug. This constitutes two separate pouring actions."
0070-7,D
0080-0,"The purpose of beating the balloon is to break the inner containers holding the vinegar and baking soda.

This action allows the two substances to mix, initiating a chemical reaction that produces carbon dioxide gas, which then inflates the balloon from the inside."
0080-1,"You need to hit the balloon **to break the inner packet containing the vinegar.**

**Explanation:** In this activity, the vinegar is sealed inside a small packet (a cut-off glove finger) which is placed inside the balloon along with baking soda. The vinegar and baking soda are kept separate until the balloon is hit. The impact of the hit breaks the packet, releasing the vinegar to mix with the baking soda. This mixing initiates a chemical reaction that produces carbon dioxide gas, inflating the balloon."
0080-2,"Yes, the purpose of hitting the balloon is to create a fun and interactive toy. Hitting the balloon initiates the chemical reaction between the vinegar and baking soda inside, causing it to inflate rapidly, mimicking a pufferfish puffing up, which serves as the toy's main interactive and amusing feature."
0080-3,"No, the purpose of hitting the balloon is not to make it pop loudly. Hitting the balloon breaks the inner container (glove finger) holding the vinegar, allowing it to mix with the baking soda already inside the balloon. This causes a chemical reaction that produces carbon dioxide gas, rapidly inflating the balloon."
0080-7,A
0081-0,"The man puts his hand on his face as a playful gesture, likely expressing mock exasperation or amusement at the woman suddenly starting her energetic and cute dance. It's a common reaction in videos like this to add humour and highlight the contrast between his initial stoic pose and her bubbly performance."
0081-1,"The man covers his face briefly as a playful reaction, likely a mock facepalm or gesture of playful exasperation/amusement, in response to the woman starting her cute dance with the filter. It's a common type of reaction in online videos to express being momentarily overwhelmed by cuteness or silliness in a lighthearted way."
0081-2,"Yes, the man covered his face to transfer the cat face filter to the girl next to him.

**Explanation:** The video shows the filter initially applied to the man's face. When he covers his face with his hand, the filter immediately disappears from him and appears on the woman's face. This sequence strongly indicates that obscuring his face caused the filter's face-tracking algorithm to lock onto the next available face, which was the woman's."
0081-3,"No, the man did not put his hand on his face as part of a synchronized dance move.

**Explanation:** While the man briefly puts his hand to his face near the beginning, the woman initiates a distinct dance routine with cat paw gestures immediately after. The man's action is not mirrored by the woman, nor does he continue with movements that coordinate with her specific dance steps. They appear to be performing separate actions rather than a synchronized routine at that moment."
0081-7,D
0083-0,"The daughter repeatedly enters the room or listens at the door to check if her mother, despite her initial harsh rejection, is secretly interacting with and growing fond of the new dog.

**Explanation:** The daughter suspects that her mother's disapproval might not last. Her repeated checks confirm this suspicion as she catches her mother feeding the dog, talking kindly to it, and even projecting parental ambitions onto it, all while trying to maintain her stern facade when the daughter is present. This highlights the common comedic trope of parents who initially dislike a pet but end up loving it the most."
0083-1,"The daughter's repeated entries convey her suspicion and serve to expose the comedic contrast between her mother's initial harsh rejection of the dog and her quickly developed secret affection for it. Each entry allows the daughter (and the audience) to witness the mother's hypocrisy as she bonds with the pet when she thinks she's alone, confirming the daughter's hunch and highlighting the common trope of a parent initially against a pet but secretly falling in love with it."
0083-2,"Yes, the daughter is trying to uncover her mother's true feelings about the pet dog by entering the room multiple times.

**Explanation:**

The mother initially reacts very negatively to the dog. However, each time the daughter leaves the room, she overhears her mother secretly being affectionate and kind towards the pet. The daughter's repeated re-entrances, culminating in her pretending to leave while actually listening at the door, show she suspects her mother's true feelings are different from what she outwardly expresses and is actively trying to confirm this hidden fondness."
0083-3,"No, the video does not show the daughter repeatedly entering the room to announce the pet dog. She enters only once at the beginning to announce she got a dog. While the video does highlight a cultural stereotype (an Asian mother initially rejecting a pet but later secretly doting on it), this is revealed through the daughter peeking and observing her mother's changed behaviour, not through repeated announcements."

0099-0,"**Two:** There are two zoomed-in close-ups in the video.
*   The first zoom occurs around the 0:09 mark, providing a closer view as the pattern becomes more intricate.
*   The second, much more significant zoom happens near the end, around the 0:54 mark, focusing intensely on a very small area of the pattern."
0099-1,"**2**

There are two zoomed-in close-ups in the video. The first occurs around 0:09-0:14, focusing on the central area as the pattern begins to form. The second occurs near the end, around 0:54-0:59, zooming in very closely on the dense intersections of the completed pattern."
0099-2,"Yes, there are two zoomed-in close-ups in the video focusing on the geometric pattern. The first zoom occurs early as the pattern begins to show complexity, and a second, much closer zoom happens later when the pattern becomes very dense, highlighting its intricate structure."
0099-3,"No, the video does not contain exactly 10 zoomed-in close-ups. Observation reveals that there are more than 10 instances where the view zooms in closer to the geometric pattern, with the count being approximately 11 distinct zoom actions."
0099-7,A
0101-0,"The sequence of locations the man appears to teleport to is:

1.  **Behind the bookshelf:** After dropping the blanket in the doorway, he first appears to burst out from behind the bookshelf.
2.  **Inside the sofa:** He then seemingly teleports inside the sofa, lifting a cushion to reveal himself.
3.  **Inside the cardboard box:** Finally, he appears inside a cardboard box on the floor.

This sequence follows the visual illusions created by the video editing, showing the man seemingly instantly moving between these locations."
0101-1,"The order of locations where the man appears after 'teleporting' is:

1.  **Bookshelf:** He first appears partially hidden inside the built-in bookshelf unit.
2.  **Sofa:** Next, he is shown emerging from within the structure of the sofa.
3.  **Cardboard Box:** Finally, he appears inside a cardboard box on the floor."
0101-2,"**No**, the man does not actually teleport in the video.

The appearances in the bookshelf, couch, and cardboard box are achieved through video editing and visual effects to create the *illusion* of teleportation for a game of hide-and-seek with the dog. He doesn't teleport back under the blanket at the end; rather, after the edited sequence showing him in different spots, he physically crawls out from under the blanket to reveal himself to the dog."
0101-3,"No, the sequence described in the question is incorrect. In the video, the man appears to teleport from the bookshelf first, then from the couch, then from the cardboard box. Finally, he reappears near his starting position holding the blanket, rather than returning to hide under it."
0101-7,B
0113-0,"Two buildings are demolished in the video.

A tall glass skyscraper is demolished via controlled implosion (0:29-0:39), and a brick water tower is knocked down by an excavator (0:54-0:59)."
0113-1,"The total number of buildings/large structures taken down in the video is 2.

A tall glass skyscraper is demolished through a controlled implosion, and a brick water tower is knocked down by an excavator."
0113-2,"Yes, two buildings are demolished in the video.

The video shows the controlled demolition of a tall glass skyscraper and, in a separate clip, the demolition of a brick water tower using an excavator."
0113-3,"No, more than one structure is demolished in the video. The video shows both the controlled implosion of a tall skyscraper and the mechanical demolition of a brick water tower by an excavator."
0113-7,A
0117-0,"**Two** toy cars are shown in the video.

**Explanation:** The segment labeled ""BOYS DRIVING"" features a scene where two individuals are riding small, low-to-the-ground vehicles resembling go-karts or modified toy cars (one white, one black) on a paved path. The other vehicles shown (driven by the girls, the drag car, the drift car) are full-sized automobiles."
0117-1,"**2**

**Explanation:** The video shows two small, low-riding vehicles, resembling toy cars or go-karts, being driven during the segment labeled ""BOYS DRIVING"". One is white (seen from a first-person perspective) and the other is black."
0117-2,"Yes, there are two toy car-like vehicles shown in the video clip. The segment labeled ""BOYS DRIVING"" features footage from a first-person perspective riding one small vehicle while following another similar vehicle."
0117-3,"No, there are not three toy cars shown in the video clip. The video shows only two vehicles that resemble modified toy cars or go-karts being ridden by individuals in the ""Boys Driving"" segment."

0118-0,"He pushed the bottles forward off the ledge. By applying force with his hand, he caused the bottles to slide along the surface until they went over the edge and fell."
0118-1,"The person pushed the first blue bottle with their hand. This push initiated a chain reaction, causing the first bottle to knock into the subsequent bottles, leading to all of them falling off the ledge."
0118-2,"Yes, the person pushed and then let go of the bottles on a sloped concrete ledge. This action, combined with the force of gravity acting on the bottles due to the slope, caused them to slide down the ledge and fall off the end."
0118-3,"Yes, the person pushed the first bottle with their hand, causing it and the others to fall. The video shows the person's hand making contact with the first bottle, immediately followed by all three bottles falling off the ledge."
0118-7,A
0127-0,"Four watches are shown in the video. After the initial unboxing, the video displays close-ups of four distinct watches, each featuring a different car wheel and brake caliper design as part of a collection."
0127-1,"There are four watches displayed in the video.

**Explanation:**
After the initial unboxing scene, the video showcases close-ups of four separate watches, each featuring a unique car-themed design (specifically resembling wheel rims and brake calipers associated with different automotive brands)."
0127-2,"Yes, there are four watches shown in the video. The video first shows someone opening a package containing a watch box, and then proceeds to showcase four distinct watches one after the other, each featuring a design inspired by car wheels and brake calipers."
0127-3,"No, there are not five watches shown in the video. The video displays four distinct watches, each with a design resembling a car's wheel, brake disc, and caliper."

0129-0,"**One man appears in the video.**

He is seen briefly assisting the woman during two different photo setups:
1.  He hands her the string for the large pink balloon (around 0:20).
2.  He adjusts her outfit and takes her photograph for the avocado scene (around 0:27)."
0129-1,"**Answer:** 1

**Explanation:**
One male figure is shown in the video. He appears briefly at the 0:20 mark to hand the woman a string for the balloon prop, and again at the 0:27 mark acting as a photographer/assistant, adjusting the woman's outfit and setting up a camera. It appears to be the same individual in both instances."
0129-2,"No, there is not only one man in the video.

The video primarily features a woman creating and posing with large props against walls. However, one man appears briefly in two scenes: first, handing the woman a string for a large pink balloon prop (around 0:20), and later, adjusting her position and photographing her while she poses with an avocado prop (around 0:27)."
0129-3,"Yes, there are two men in the video. One man briefly appears to hand the woman the string for the pink balloon setup, and another man appears at the end during the avocado setup, adjusting the woman's outfit and preparing to take a photograph."
0129-7,C
0133-0,"The final scene depicts three men simultaneously jumping through a large, moving hoop.

**Explanation:** This scene showcases physics principles like projectile motion (the path the men take through the air after jumping), kinematics (the study of motion, including the hoop's movement and the men's jumps), and the importance of precise timing and coordination to successfully navigate the moving obstacle."
0133-1,"The final scene shows three men in a gymnasium jumping through a single hula hoop simultaneously. This coordinated action serves as the video's concluding example illustrating a principle of physics, likely related to simultaneous motion and timing."
0133-2,"Yes, the final scene depicts three men performing a stunt by jumping through a hula hoop.

**Explanation:** The video clip clearly shows three men simultaneously jumping through a single hula hoop held close to the ground by one of them in what appears to be a gym or training facility. This coordinated jump through the hoop constitutes a stunt."
0133-3,"No, the final scene is not a demonstration of a spinning wheel's gyroscopic effect. It shows three men performing a coordinated jump through a large, stationary hoop in a gymnasium, which is an athletic activity rather than a physics demonstration involving a spinning wheel's resistance to changes in orientation. The gyroscopic effect was demonstrated earlier in the video with a spinning bicycle wheel in a classroom setting."
0133-7,D
0142-0,"The purpose of the character in the Spider-Man costume placing the white wipe (not tape) on the handrail is **to visually demonstrate how dirty the escalator handrail is.**

**Explanation:** By holding the clean wipe stationary against the moving handrail, the wipe collects the accumulated dirt and grime from the surface passing underneath it. This provides a stark visual contrast between the clean wipe and the dirty one, serving as dramatic proof (answering the video's ""Real or Fake?"" question) of the handrail's uncleanliness, likely for social media engagement and to raise awareness about hygiene in public spaces."
0142-1,"The character in the costume places a white wipe (not tape) on the escalator handrail.

He does this to demonstrate how much dirt and grime accumulates on the moving handrail by collecting it onto the clean wipe, visually proving the surface is dirty, likely in response to the video's ""Real or Fake?"" question."
0142-2,"The purpose is to test the cleanliness of that specific escalator handrail and provide a visual answer to the ""Real or Fake?"" question posed at the start of the video.

**Brief Explanation:** The video first shows a wipe becoming extremely dirty on a handrail, implying they are very unsanitary (""Real?""). The character in the Spider-Man costume then uses a fresh, clean wipe on a different (or perhaps the same, later) handrail. By holding the wipe against the moving rail and showing it remains relatively clean, the character demonstrates that *this* handrail isn't as filthy as the initial example suggested, thus contrasting the first clip and addressing the ""Fake?"" possibility."
0142-3,"**No**, the object is not a piece of white tape attached to the armrest.

**Explanation:** The video shows a person dressed as Spider-Man holding a white tissue or wipe against the moving escalator handrail. The tissue collects dirt through direct contact with the already dirty surface, demonstrating how much grime is present, rather than being tape attached to attract dust."

0151-1,"The person holding the potato is wearing a red, long-sleeved top. Their hands and arms are visible, showing fair skin, as they hold a potato and a blue straw. They are demonstrating a trick where they cover the end of the straw with their thumb before successfully pushing it through the potato, illustrating the effect of compressed air. Only their torso, arms, and hands are shown against a plain background; their face is not visible."
0151-2,"No, the person holding the potato has long brown hair and is wearing a red top, but the top appears to be a sweater or long-sleeved shirt, not a coat."
0151-3,"No, the person holding the potato is not wearing a light pink hoodie and a black cap. The video shows that the person demonstrating the experiment with the potato and straw is wearing a red top.

0152-0,"The tools used for fixing the position of the pages are **Elastic Cords** (or Elastic Bands).

**Explanation:** Two blue elastic cords are wrapped horizontally around the book's pages. They provide tension to hold the already folded sections tightly together, preventing them from unfolding and maintaining the structure of the artwork as more pages are folded."
0152-1,The tool used to secure the pages in place appears to be two blue elastic cords or bands. They are wrapped horizontally around the book to hold the folded pages tightly together and maintain the shape of the book art during the folding process.
0152-2,"Yes, the tool used to hold the pages in place is blue and functions as a temporary retainer. It appears to be a blue elastic cord or band used to keep the folded sections together during the book folding process."
0152-3,"**No**, the tool used is not a typical rubber band. It appears to be a blue elastic cord, which is round in shape, unlike the flat profile of a standard rubber band."

0162-0,"The golfer successfully hits the target 11 times.

Each clip in the video shows the golfer successfully striking the object placed in the foreground, including a bell, eggs, a candle, a balloon, a golf ball, a glass of Guinness, a light bulb, and a chocolate orange."
0162-1,"The golfer achieves 11 successful target hits in the video. Each shot shown in the compilation results in the golf ball making contact with the intended target (bell, egg, candle, balloon, egg, golf ball, Guinness, lightbulb, chocolate orange, egg, golf ball)."
0162-2,"No, the golfer does not hit the target only once. The video is a compilation showing the golfer successfully hitting multiple different targets, including a bell, an egg, a candle, a balloon, a glass, a lightbulb, and a chocolate orange, among others."
0162-3,"No, the golfer does not manage to hit the target exactly 10 times.

The video shows the golfer successfully hitting the target 11 times."

0167-0,"The woman is surprised because the man successfully performed an illusion, making it appear as though he was breaking the wooden stick between his fists. His actions and facial expressions created the expectation that the stick would snap, so when he revealed it was still intact, the unexpected outcome caused her surprise."
0167-1,"The woman feels astonished because the stick did not break when she tried to snap it between her fists, despite the man making it look like he easily broke it just moments before. Her failure to replicate his apparent feat makes her realize she was likely fooled by a trick or sleight of hand, and the stick is much sturdier than she was led to believe, leading to her surprised reaction."
0167-2,"Yes, the woman is surprised because the pencil remains unbroken despite the man's grip.

**Explanation:** The video shows the man making a show of trying to break the pencil between his fists, tensing and shaking them. When he opens his hands and the pencil is revealed to be intact, the woman's expression changes to wide-eyed shock and a broad smile, indicating her surprise that the pencil did not break as expected from the man's actions."
0167-3,"**Yes**, the woman is surprised.

**Explanation:** When the man opens his hands to reveal the broken pencil, the woman's eyes widen significantly, her mouth opens in an 'O' shape, and she breaks into a large, astonished smile. This immediate and pronounced facial expression is a clear indication of surprise at the outcome."

0169-0,"The woman pours juice into the molds 2 times in the video.

She pours orange juice into one mold once, and then she pours red juice into another mold once."
0169-1,"The woman fills a mold with juice 2 times in the video.

She first fills one mold with an orange-colored liquid and then fills another mold with a red-colored liquid."
0169-2,"Yes, the woman pours juice into the mold twice in the video.

**Explanation:**

1.  First, she pours orange-colored juice from a plastic bottle into one of the empty metal molds.
2.  Second, she pours red-colored juice from a different plastic bottle into another empty metal mold."
0169-3,"No, the woman does not pour juice into the mold three times in the video.

**Explanation:** The video shows the woman pouring juice into the molds only two times: once with orange juice and once with red juice."

0179-0,"3 times: The person swings the machete three distinct times against the stem holding the banana bunch. The first two swings weaken the stem, and the third swing severs it completely, allowing the bunch to be harvested."
0179-1,The stem has been cut **one** time. The person uses a machete to make a single cut through the main pseudostem of the banana plant to harvest the bunch.
0179-2,"No, the person does not cut the stem with just one swing. The video shows the person striking the banana stem multiple times with the machete before it is fully cut."
0179-3,"No, the person does not cut the stem 10 times. They cut the stem approximately 6 times with the machete before it breaks off."

0217-0,"The time lapse of the demonstration of capillary action lasted precisely 6 seconds in the physical time of the video.

Explanation: The time-lapse segment begins when the clock appears on screen at the 0:08 mark and ends at the 0:14 mark of the video."
0217-1,"The exact duration of the capillary action demonstration shown in the sped-up portion of the video, in real time, was approximately **40 seconds**.

**Explanation:** The video indicates ""x8 Speed"" during the demonstration segment, which lasts for about 5 seconds on screen (from roughly 0:09 to 0:14). To find the real-time duration, we multiply the observed time by the speed factor: 5 seconds * 8 = 40 seconds. The analog clock shown also visually confirms this, advancing by approximately 40 seconds during the sped-up sequence."
0217-2,"Yes.

The clock in the video shows a start time of approximately 10:10 and an end time of approximately 11:25. The difference between these times is one hour and fifteen minutes."
0217-3,"Yes, the time lapse of the capillary action demonstration lasted approximately 2 hours as indicated by the clock in the video.

The clock's hands visibly move from roughly 10:10 at the start of the time-lapse segment to approximately 12:10 at the end, indicating a passage of 2 hours during the sped-up observation."

0242-0,"The two orange cats jumped away because the person in the red hat/shirt made a sudden movement towards them and simultaneously created a loud noise by hitting the countertop, which startled the cats."
0242-1,"The two orange cats leaped away because the person wearing a red hat made a sudden movement towards them while simultaneously making a loud, sharp noise. This combination of abrupt visual and auditory stimuli startled the cats, triggering their instinctive flight response to escape the perceived sudden threat or disturbance."
0242-2,"No, the two orange cats jumped away because a person used a party blower near them, but the person was wearing a grey hoodie, not a red hat."
0242-3,"No, the video does not show two orange cats jumping away because they were frightened by a toy snake.

**Explanation:**
In the video compilation:
*   At the beginning (0:00-0:02), one orange cat watches calmly while a different (grey) cat reacts strongly to a red and black toy snake.
*   Later (0:05-0:07), a *single* orange cat is shown being startled by and jumping away from a *green* toy snake.
*   Another clip (0:17-0:19) shows two orange cats jumping off a counter, but this is because a person startles them, not due to a toy snake.

Therefore, the specific event of *two* orange cats jumping away simultaneously due to fright from a toy snake does not happen in this video."

0248-1,"The person is painting a highlight onto a large portrait. They are using a fine paintbrush to meticulously apply a small dot of white paint onto a depicted water droplet on the subject's nose, enhancing the artwork's realism by simulating the reflection of light."
0248-2,"**Yes**, the person in the foreground is painting a hyperrealistic image of a wet-haired woman. The video shows the artist using a fine paintbrush to apply paint, specifically adding a highlight to a water droplet on the nose of the portrait. The image itself exhibits an extreme level of detail in rendering the wet hair, skin texture, and water droplets, which are characteristic features of hyperrealism."
0248-3,"No, the person is not under running water. The video shows an artist's hand using a fine brush to paint a highlight onto one of the water droplets on the person's nose, indicating that the image is a hyperrealistic painting, and the water droplets are painted effects, not actual water."

0251-0,"The ball falls off the disc because the mechanical straw figures supporting the disc move, causing the disc to tilt. This tilting creates an inclined surface, and when the angle becomes steep enough near the edge, gravity causes the ball to roll over the side and fall off."
0251-1,"The ball falls off the disc because the mechanical figures supporting the disc move, causing the disc to tilt significantly. This tilting creates a steep enough incline for gravity to pull the ball, causing it to roll down the slope and off the edge."
0251-2,"No, the ball was not thrown.

The movement of the mechanical figures underneath causes the disc to tilt. Gravity then pulls the ball, causing it to roll down the tilted surface towards the edge."
0251-3,"Yes, the ball fell off (or is strongly implied to fall off at the end of the clip) the disc precisely because the disc was tilted. The movement of the mechanical figures supporting the disc causes it to tilt. Due to the force of gravity, the ball then rolls down the inclined surface created by the tilt, eventually reaching the edge and falling off."

0259-1,The man does not discard his hat in the video. He keeps it on his head for the entire duration of the clip.
0259-2,"No, the man did not use his left hand to throw away his hat after failing to score. After missing the second shot with a tiny club, he threw that specific tiny club away using his right hand, while his hat remained on his head."
0259-3,"Yes, the man used his right hand to throw away his hat. He did this in a moment of frustration after missing a mini-golf putt with a tiny club."

0266-0,"Both the left and right thumbs have the yellow rubber band looped around them during the main part of the trick (approximately 0:02 to 0:16).

**Explanation:** The rubber band starts around the right thumb (and index finger). During the manipulation, a loop is explicitly formed around the left thumb, while the band remains stretched from and looped around the right thumb as well, using both as anchor points to create the shapes."
0266-1,"The yellow rubber band is not completely wrapped around either thumb.

**Explanation:** The video shows the rubber band initially stretched between the right thumb and the right index finger. Throughout the manipulation and at the end, it never forms a complete, independent loop solely around either the left or the right thumb."
0266-2,"Yes, the yellow rubber band is fully looped around the left thumb. During the main part of the trick shown (approximately 0:02 to 0:16), the band clearly encircles the base of the left thumb, forming a complete loop around it, although it is also stretched to other fingers."
0266-3,"Yes, the yellow rubber band is fully looped around the right thumb during the main part of the trick.

**Explanation:** While the rubber band starts stretched between the index finger and thumb (0:00) and returns to that state at the end (0:17), it is intentionally looped fully around the base of the right thumb from approximately 0:02 to 0:16 as a necessary step to perform the finger trick."

0267-0,"The first person in the video is **pretending to hang from a painted line on the ground.**

*   **Explanation:** This is a forced perspective illusion created by the overhead camera angle. The person is likely lying on the sports court or jumping, positioning their hand near the white line to make it appear as if they are suspended from it."
0267-1,"The first person in the video is **pretending to hang from a painted line**.

**Explanation:** He is actually lying flat on the sports court, but the overhead camera angle creates a forced perspective illusion, making it appear as though he is suspended in the air and hanging by one arm from the white line."
0267-2,"Yes, the person is creating an illusion by lying flat on the basketball court. The overhead camera angle, combined with the person's pose aligning their hand with the painted white line, creates the false impression that they are hanging from the line. Since a painted line cannot support a person's weight, this is a visual trick known as forced perspective."
0267-3,"The person in the video is **jumping**.

**Explanation:** The image captures the person mid-air, having propelled themselves upward from the ground using their legs. This action fits the definition of jumping. While the pose creates an illusion of hanging, the physical act required to become airborne in this manner is a jump."

0274-0,"**5 people appear in the video.**

*   **Explanation:** The video shows a dance practice in a studio featuring one central dancer and four additional dancers positioned around him, making a total of five individuals visible."
0274-1,There are 5 individuals visible in the video. This includes the main dancer in the center and the four backup dancers surrounding him.
0274-2,"**No**, the total number of people consistently visible in the video is five. There is one main dancer in the center and four backup dancers performing the choreography alongside him throughout the clip."
0274-3,"No, the total number of people visible in the video frames is five.

**Explanation:** The video initially shows four dancers. A fifth dancer joins them from the left side shortly after the start. Throughout the clip, only these five individuals are seen dancing in the frame."
0274-7,D
0276-0,"No, video editing effects do not appear to be used to make the illusion believable.

**Explanation:**

The illusion is created using a practical technique known as anamorphic drawing combined with paper manipulation. The cube is drawn in a specific perspective, and then the paper is physically cut along the top and one side of the drawing and folded upwards. This creates a physical flap that, when viewed from the correct angle, appears to be a solid 3D object floating above the page. The pencil can then physically pass behind this folded flap, reinforcing the illusion. The end of the video, where the paper flap is lifted, reveals the physical nature of the trick, confirming it's not a digital effect."
0276-1,"The illusion is created using a combination of techniques:

1.  **Cut-out Paper:** The top part of the cube drawing is physically cut out from the sheet of paper along its upper edges.
    *   *Explanation:* This creates a real gap behind the upper portion of the drawing, allowing the pencil to physically slide behind the paper, giving the appearance of passing underneath the ""cube"".
2.  **Forced Perspective/Anamorphic Drawing:** The cube is drawn in a distorted manner (anamorphic) so that it appears correctly proportioned and three-dimensional only when viewed from a specific, fixed camera angle (forced perspective).
    *   *Explanation:* The distortion compensates for the viewing angle, making the flat drawing look like a solid 3D object.
3.  **Strategic Camera Angle:** The video is filmed from the precise viewpoint where the distorted drawing looks correct and the cut edge aligns seamlessly with the rest of the drawing.
    *   *Explanation:* Moving the camera would break the illusion by revealing the cut and the drawing's distortion.
4.  **Shading and Shadow:** Realistic shading is applied to the sides of the drawn cube, and a shadow is drawn beneath it.
    *   *Explanation:* These elements add visual cues for depth and solidity, reinforcing the impression that the drawing is a three-dimensional object casting a shadow."
0276-2,"**No**, the illusion does not rely on video editing effects like masking.

**Explanation:** The illusion is a practical effect created using anamorphic art and perspective. The drawing of the cube is physically cut out along some edges and likely folded or propped up slightly. When the pencil moves, it physically passes *behind* this cut-out section of paper. From the specific camera angle, this physical movement behind the paper creates the convincing illusion of the pencil passing *under* the drawn cube. The video confirms this by showing the paper being lifted, revealing the cut."
0276-3,"Yes. The illusion is created solely through skillful drawing, perspective, and a physical manipulation of the paper. The video reveals at the end that the paper has been cut and folded, allowing part of the drawing to stand upright, which creates the 3D effect when viewed from a specific angle. No video editing is involved."

0278-0,"**Black and Red:** The original polynomial problem is written in black ink, while the steps showing the factoring process and the final answer are written in red ink."
0278-1,"The text written on the paper is in two colors: black and red/orange.

*   The initial problem statement (""Factor the polynomial."") and the polynomial itself (""3x³ + x² - 15x - 5"") are written in **black**.
*   The steps demonstrating the factorization process, including the grouping and the final factors, are written using a marker with **red/orange** ink."
0278-2,"No, the writing on the paper is not orange. The initial problem statement is written in black ink, and the steps shown being written during the video are in red ink, even though the marker used has an orange body."
0278-3,"No, the writing on the paper in the video is not red. The person uses an orange marker to write the mathematical steps, resulting in orange writing."

0288-0,"**The large cleaver knife.**

**Explanation:** While the man demonstrates proficiency with the cleaver on various items, the woman visibly struggles and is unable to easily cut the thick piece of meat/fat with the same knife, even when instructed to use two hands. This difficulty highlights that the knife is not easy for everyone to use, particularly for that specific task."
0288-1,"The large cleaver shown in the video is difficult to use. This difficulty is demonstrated when the man attempts, and fails, to cut through the metal chain and the metal wrench. It also requires significant force to chop through the large bone."
0288-2,"Yes, the knife with the darker black steel part is the one that is not easy to use.

This is demonstrated near the end of the video when the woman attempts to cut a thick piece of pork belly/fatback with the darker knife. Despite using two hands and applying significant pressure, she is unable to make a cut, showing that this particular knife is ineffective or difficult to use for that task compared to the cleaver used earlier."
0288-3,"**Yes**, the lighter silver steel knife is the one that is not easy to use.

**Explanation:** The video shows the woman struggling significantly to cut through items like a paper towel roll, a folded cloth, and a piece of pork belly using the lighter silver knife. She requires guidance, uses two hands, and still does not achieve clean or easy cuts, indicating difficulty in using this particular knife for the demonstrated tasks."
0288-7,C
0291-0,"The rotation is caused by the **ion wind** (also known as electric wind or electrohydrodynamic thrust).

**Explanation:** The high voltage from the device ionizes air molecules near the sharp tips of the metal rod. These charged ions are then strongly repelled by the electric field, colliding with neutral air molecules and creating a directed flow of air away from the tips. Due to Newton's Third Law (action-reaction), as the rod pushes this ionized air away tangentially, the air exerts an equal and opposite force back on the rod, creating a torque that causes it to spin."
0291-1,"**Initiation:** The rotational movement of the metal rod was initiated by a manual push from a hand, giving it the initial spin.

**Continuation:** The rotation is sustained by the device underneath, which is a Tesla coil generating a high-voltage, high-frequency electric field. This field causes the air around the sharp tips of the metal rod to ionize, creating plasma discharges (corona discharge). The expulsion of these ions from the tips generates a reaction force, often called an ""ion wind"" or ""electric wind,"" which provides a continuous thrust, applying torque to the rod and keeping it spinning (acting as a corona motor or ion windmill)."
0291-2,"No, the initial rotation of the metal rod did not start because a human plucked it. The rotation began immediately when an electrical arc from the central emitter struck the small metal piece attached to the rod, indicating the rotation was initiated by the force of the electrical discharge itself, not a manual action by the person holding it."
0291-3,"**Answer:** No

**Explanation:** The rotational movement is not caused solely by the interaction between the electric field and the metal rod. The rotation is primarily driven by the interaction of the electrical discharge (plasma arcs) at the tips of the rod with the surrounding air. This phenomenon, often referred to as ""ion wind"" or ""electric wind,"" occurs when the strong electric field ionizes air molecules near the tips. These ions are then accelerated by the field, colliding with neutral air molecules and transferring momentum, creating a net thrust that pushes the rod tips and causes rotation. The surrounding air is essential for this thrust generation mechanism."

0292-0,"There are **zero** vehicles clearly visible directly behind the bus.

**Explanation:** During the part of the video where the bus is actively driving past the camera (around 0:01-0:03), no vehicles can be seen immediately following it in the footage."
0292-1,"One vehicle is following the bus.

Explanation: In the video sequence before the final long exposure shot is shown, after the bus passes the camera, a single red car is seen driving past in the same direction."
0292-2,"No, there is more than one vehicle behind the bus after it passes. The final long exposure photograph clearly shows light trails from multiple vehicles traveling behind the bus."
0292-3,"No, there are not two vehicles following the bus as seen by two sets of headlights. The light trails visible in the final long exposure photograph are created by the single bus shown passing the camera; the different colored streaks (red, blue/white) originate from the various lights on the bus itself (like taillights and side/marker lights) being stretched out over the duration of the exposure."

0295-0,"The person holding the yellow bag tried **two methods**.

First, they attempted to pour the yellow substance into the bottle while the nozzle cap was still screwed on. After realizing this wouldn't work (and the other person removed the cap), they then tried the second method: pouring the substance directly into the open neck of the bottle."
0295-1,"**One technique.**

**Explanation:** The person holding the yellow bag only attempted one technique: pouring the contents from the large bag into the smaller squeeze bottle. Their action remained consistent throughout the attempt, even when the cap was removed by the other person."
0295-2,"Yes, the person with the yellow bag tried two methods to pour the contents.

*   **Explanation:** Initially, they tried pouring the contents from the bag directly into the small nozzle opening of the yellow squeeze bottle. When this didn't work well, the other person removed the entire top of the squeeze bottle, and the person with the bag then poured the contents into the wider main opening of the bottle."
0295-3,"No, the person with the yellow bag did not try three methods to pour the contents.

*   **Explanation:** The person first attempted to pour the contents from the yellow bag into the yellow bottle through the small nozzle opening. When this proved difficult, another person removed the nozzle top, creating a wider opening. The person with the bag then successfully poured the contents through this larger opening. These represent only two distinct methods: pouring through the nozzle and pouring through the main bottle opening."

0296-0,"The man doesn't catch the blue pants on his first attempt because they appear to shrink dramatically into a miniature version just as they fly towards him. This sudden and unexpected change in size, likely achieved through a visual effect or editing trick, causes him to miss the object he was initially reaching for."
0296-1,"The man misses catching the blue pants because a child runs past him just as the pants arrive. This sudden movement likely distracts the man, breaking his concentration at the critical moment needed to make the catch."
0296-2,"**No**, the reason the man misses hanging the blue pants is not due to a visual illusion.

**Explanation:** The video employs a trick or special effect. The man reaches for the normal-sized blue pants, which are then quickly swapped or edited out and replaced with miniature pants that he subsequently picks up. The ""miss"" is part of this staged sequence to create the comedic effect of the pants having shrunk, rather than a result of the man misperceiving the location due to a visual illusion."
0296-3,"No, the reason the man doesn't catch the blue pants on his first attempt is not because they are a painted object.

The scene uses a visual trick or special effect. The man reaches for the large blue pants hanging on the line (which appear to be a physical prop), but his hand seems to pass through them. This ""failed catch"" is staged to set up the reveal where he then shows a small, flat, painted representation of the pants, creating the comedic effect that they ""shrunk in the wash."" The failure is part of the trick, not a result of the large pants being painted or intangible."

0303-0,"The man stops cycling by dismounting the bike after landing his trick.

**Explanation:** After successfully completing the aerial maneuver and landing on the large inflatable ramp, he rides down onto the flat ground area. He then steps off the bicycle, letting it fall beside him, bringing his ride to an end."
0303-1,"The man brings his cycling to a halt by riding directly into a large inflatable wall or barrier.

**Explanation:** After landing his aerial trick, the rider continues towards the end of the performance area and intentionally directs his bike into the large, soft inflatable structure. He appears to dismount or prepare to run just before the bike hits, and then both he and the bike impact the inflatable, which absorbs their momentum and brings them to a stop."
0303-2,"**No**, the man does not stop cycling by jumping off his bike and crashing into a cushion.

**Explanation:** The video shows the man performing a BMX trick, landing successfully on the large inflatable cushion (which is a landing ramp or airbag), riding down it, and then jumping off his bike onto the flat ground as it comes to a stop. The cushion is used for a controlled landing, not for crashing into to stop."
0303-3,"Yes, the man stops cycling by dismounting and walking away.

*   **Explanation:** After landing the aerial trick on the large ramp, the cyclist rides forward briefly, then gets off his bike, leaves it on the ramp surface, and walks away while celebrating."

0304-0,"The person initially writes on one layer of paper. This top layer, containing the equation ""128√e980"", acts as a cover that is lifted to reveal text written on a layer beneath it."
0304-1,"The person starts writing on one sheet of paper. Although there is a horizontal line drawn across the paper which might make it look like two sections, the writing begins on a single, continuous surface above that line."
0304-2,"**No**, the person initially writes on what appears to be a single surface or layer of paper.

**Explanation:** The pen makes contact with one visible sheet of paper as the characters are being written. Although this sheet is later revealed to be cut or composed of two sections that separate along a horizontal line, the act of writing itself happens on this single apparent layer, crossing the line that divides the sections. There is no indication of writing on two *stacked* layers simultaneously."
0304-3,"**No**, the person does not write on just one layer of paper.

The writing is done on a top layer of paper that has been cut horizontally. This top layer is placed over a second layer. When the top portion of the cut layer is lifted, it reveals parts of the message ""I Love you"" written on the bottom layer, completing the illusion. The trick fundamentally requires two layers of paper."

0308-1,"The initial military aircraft is attempting to land on the aircraft carrier.

**Explanation:** The jet is shown approaching the flight deck on a low trajectory and aligned with the landing area, which is consistent with the initial phase of a carrier landing attempt before it pulls up sharply."
0308-2,"Yes, the first military aircraft appears to be attempting to land on the aircraft carrier but fails on that approach.

It lines up with the carrier deck for landing, but just before touching down, it abruptly pulls up and banks away, indicating an aborted landing or a ""wave-off."""

0319-0,"At the end of the video, the ball is at rest on the black table surface, positioned just in front of the opening of the circular track and very close to the beginning of the line labeled 'C' on the paper diagram.

**Explanation:** This demonstrates Newton's First Law of Motion (inertia). While inside the circular track, the track's wall exerted an inward (centripetal) force, forcing the ball to move in a circle. When the ball exited the track through the opening, this constraining force was removed. Due to inertia, the ball continued to move in a straight line tangent to the circular path at the point of exit, which corresponds to path C. Friction with the table eventually caused the ball to slow down and stop."
0319-1,"The ball follows **Path C**.

**Explanation:** According to Newton's First Law of Motion (inertia), an object in motion will stay in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. While inside the ring, the ring exerts an inward centripetal force on the ball, forcing it into a circular path. When the ball exits the ring, this constraining force is removed. The ball then continues to move in a straight line tangent to the point where it left the circle, which corresponds to Path C."
0319-2,"Yes, the ball ends its motion along path C and is then put back into the circular wooden piece by the person.

The video shows the ball rolling inside the circular track. When a section of the track is removed, the ball continues in a straight line tangent to the point where it left the circle, which corresponds to path C on the diagram. After the ball stops along path C, the person picks it up and places it back inside the reassembled circular wooden piece."
0319-3,"No, the ball does not end up at position A. Once the constraint of the circular track is removed, the ball continues to travel in a straight line tangent to the point where it left the track due to inertia. This corresponds to path C on the diagram."

**Explanation:** The video shows multiple hands arranged in a circle against the sky. The individuals simultaneously change their hand gestures in unison, starting with fists, then transitioning to peace signs, and finally forming finger hearts. This synchronized movement indicates a planned or choreographed sequence."
0321-1,"The people in the group are performing a synchronized hand routine.

**Explanation:** They are standing in a circle and simultaneously performing a sequence of hand gestures – starting with fists (""rock""), changing to ""scissors,"" returning to fists, and ending with a finger heart gesture – all coordinated together, likely timed to the background music beat."
0321-2,"Yes, the people in the group are filming a video with hand gesture choreography.

**Explanation:** The video shows multiple individuals performing a synchronized sequence of hand gestures (changing from fists to peace signs, then to finger hearts) in unison. This coordinated and planned movement constitutes choreography, and the camera angle suggests it is being intentionally recorded for a video, likely for social media given the overlay tag."
0321-3,"Yes, the people in the group appear to be playing a game of rock, paper, scissors. They start with their hands in fists (the 'rock' position) and then simultaneously reveal their chosen hand gestures, with some showing 'scissors' while others keep the 'rock' fist."

0325-0,"The rider flips 4 times while jumping in the air crossing obstacles.

Explanation: The rider performs a backflip (jump 2), a backflip barspin (jump 6), a front flip (jump 7), and a cash roll tailwhip (jump 8) during distinct jumps over obstacles or gaps in the course. Other jumps involved tricks like tailwhips or 360 spins, which are not flips."
0325-1,"The rider performs **4 flips** and **7 jumps** while navigating the obstacles.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Jumps:** The rider becomes airborne 7 times from distinct ramps or features on the course. These are the main aerial maneuvers counted as jumps. (A very small hop onto a platform early in the run is generally not counted as one of the main 'jumps' in this context).
2.  **Flips:** During these jumps, the rider executes 4 maneuvers involving vertical, upside-down rotation:
    *   Flair (Backflip with 180 twist)
    *   Backflip Barspin
    *   Front Flip Tailwhip
    *   Cash Roll Tailwhip (an off-axis/corked flip)"
0325-2,"**False.**

**Explanation:**

Based on the video, the rider performs several tricks over multiple obstacles. Counting the distinct major jumps and flips reveals:

1.  **Jump 1:** Step-down jump (no flip).
2.  **Jump 2:** Box jump with a tailwhip (no flip).
3.  **Jump 3:** Jump off a quarter pipe feature with a cash roll (rotation/body varial, counted as 1 flip).
4.  **Jump 4:** 360 jump off a quarter pipe (rotation, not a flip).
5.  **Jump 5:** Backflip barspin off a large ramp (1 flip).
6.  **Jump 6:** Front flip off a large ramp (1 flip).
7.  **Jump 7:** Cash roll tailwhip off the final ramp (counted as 1 flip).

The rider performs a total of **7 major jumps** and **4 flips/flip variations** (Cash Roll, Backflip, Frontflip, Cash Roll Tailwhip) during this sequence. Therefore, the statement that the rider flipped and jumped eight times is incorrect as neither the jump count (7) nor the flip count (4) is eight."
0325-3,"No, the rider did not flip and jump only three times while crossing the obstacles.

**Explanation:**

The rider performed multiple jumps and flips throughout the course. Counting the distinct aerial maneuvers:

1.  Initial jump/drop-in.
2.  Jump off the cube obstacle with a trick.
3.  Jump off the curved ramp.
4.  Jump off the next ramp with a 360 tailwhip variation.
5.  360 jump off the following ramp.
6.  Backflip Barspin (Jump 6, Flip 1).
7.  Front Flip (Jump 7, Flip 2).
8.  Cash Roll Tailwhip (Jump 8, Flip 3).

The rider executed at least 8 jumps and 3 flips, far exceeding a total of only three combined flips and jumps."

This scene shows a giant pencil eraser clearing a path through tangled roads for a person. This is not a real-life photograph using forced perspective; it appears to be a digital illustration or composite image representing a concept, as the scale and the erasing action are physically impossible to capture in reality without significant digital manipulation."
0334-1,"All scenes in the video depict unrealistic situations created through optical illusions or digital manipulation:

1.  **Water bottle pouring upwards:** Water defies gravity, appearing to flow upwards to match the waterfall, achieved through forced perspective.
2.  **Scissors forming bridge cables:** Scissor handles are aligned with a bridge's cables using forced perspective, creating an impossible structure.
3.  **Key framing an archway:** A key is held up to perfectly frame a large arch using forced perspective.
4.  **Hanger forming a bridge:** A clothes hanger is positioned to mimic the structure of a real bridge through forced perspective.
5.  **Highlighters resembling buildings:** Highlighters are held to look like canal houses using forced perspective.
6.  **Person ""eating"" the sun:** Forced perspective and silhouette create the illusion of someone about to eat the sun from a bowl.
7.  **Giant pencil erasing roads:** This is a digitally manipulated image representing a concept, not a real event.
8.  **Whisk acting as a birdcage:** A whisk is held up so birds flying in the distance appear caged inside due to forced perspective."
0334-2,"Yes, the scene with the pencil erasing the road is a digitally created image.

**Explanation:**

The scale of the pencil is impossibly large compared to the person and the roads. Furthermore, a pencil eraser cannot physically erase asphalt roads. The effect of the roads disappearing to reveal a clear path is achieved through digital image manipulation, creating a surreal and metaphorical visual."

0340-0,"There are four main drainage channels built into the dam wall.

**Explanation:** During the construction of the main dam wall, the man uses hollow bricks to create four distinct, rectangular openings (visible from 0:15-0:17). These openings serve as the primary channels for water to pass through the dam structure. A separate overflow spillway is also built later on the side (0:52-0:56), but the main integrated drainage channels within the wall itself are four in number."
0340-1,"There are a total of 5 drainage channels shown in the video.

**Explanation:**
1.  **Main Outlets (4):** The main structure of the dam is built with four distinct rectangular openings designed to allow water to flow through (visible around 0:16-0:18).
2.  **Overflow Channel/Spillway (1):** An additional, separate channel is dug along the side slope (visible around 0:52-0:53). This acts as a spillway or overflow channel to manage excess water when the main dam reaches capacity."
0340-2,"Yes, it is true that there are four drainage channels visible in the video.

**Explanation:** Around the 0:16-0:17 mark, the video shows the man constructing the dam wall. He uses three vertically placed hollow bricks to create four distinct rectangular openings within the wall. The Chinese text overlay at this point explicitly states these are ""4个出水的孔洞"" (4 water outlet holes/openings), which serve as drainage channels. These four openings remain visible as the primary water outlets through the main dam structure in subsequent steps."
0340-3,"Yes, there are five drainage channels shown in the video.

**Explanation:**
The main dam structure is built with four distinct openings designed as primary water outlets. Additionally, a separate channel is dug into the side slope next to the main structure, serving as an auxiliary spillway or overflow channel. This brings the total number of drainage channels to five (4 main + 1 side)."

**Explanation:** His initial reaction upon pulling out the pickle is one of clear surprise, with wide eyes and an open mouth. This expression quickly transitions into hearty laughter, indicating he finds the unexpected and absurd nature of discovering a pickle humorous, possibly seeing it as a funny or unlucky draw compared to what others might find."
0357-1,"The man in the white T-shirt feels a mix of disgust and amusement.

His initial facial expression, with wide eyes and an open mouth showing a grimace, indicates shock and disgust upon pulling out a pickle. However, he immediately bursts into laughter, suggesting he also finds the absurdity of finding a pickle in dissolved cotton candy amusing, especially in contrast to the money someone else found."
0357-2,"No, the man in the white T-shirt did not smile wryly or look disappointed.

**Explanation:** When he dissolved the pink cotton candy and discovered a pickle inside, his reaction was one of initial shock (wide eyes) immediately followed by loud, genuine laughter, throwing his head back in amusement. This indicates surprise and finding the situation funny, not disappointment or a wry expression."
0357-3,"No, the man in the white T-shirt did not feel satisfied and happy when he took out his item.

**Explanation:** He pulled out a pickle after dissolving the cotton candy.

**Explanation:** The performer holds the yellow balloon and puts the small yellow piece in their mouth, pretending to inflate the main balloon through this piece. This creates the illusion of inflating the balloon in an unusual way, likely relying on the balloon already being inflated (misdirection)."
0374-1,"The magic trick was executed using sleight of hand and misdirection.

**Explanation:** The performer did not actually tear a piece from the balloon. Instead, they had a small, red, edible item (like candy or gum) concealed in their hand or fingers beforehand. While pretending to pinch and pull a piece from the balloon's surface, they subtly revealed the hidden item and then brought that item to their mouth to eat. The balloon remained intact throughout the illusion."
0374-2,"Yes, the magic trick in the first part of the video involved using a balloon and an extra knot.

**Explanation:** The video initially shows a person appearing to quickly tie and untie a knot on a red balloon. However, the subsequent explanation reveals the secret: a separate, pre-tied knot (likely cut from another balloon) is placed over the opening of the inflated balloon. This creates the illusion that the balloon itself is tied. The magician then pretends to untie or blow this fake knot off."
0374-3,"The magic trick in the first part of the video was performed to create the illusion of **inserting** an object into the balloon.

0417-2,"**Yes.**

The person on the left is trying not to laugh precisely because the event appears to be a formal and serious ceremony (indicated by the uniforms, the flag, the saluting, and the official setting). Laughing during such an occasion would be unprofessional and inappropriate, so despite the humorous situation with the flag covering his colleague's face, the seriousness of the event requires him to maintain composure and suppress his amusement."
0417-3,"No, the person on the left appears to be trying not to laugh because of the comical situation unfolding beside them, where the flag has covered the head of the person on the right during a formal event.

0427-0,"The man achieved this illusion using a mirror and two watermelons.

He placed a mirror horizontally on the stand beneath where he cut the first watermelon. He only cut the top half of this watermelon. When he lifted the top half away, the mirror reflected the remaining bottom half, making it appear to the viewer as if a complete, cut watermelon was still sitting there. He then reached under the mirror/stand to retrieve a second, whole, uncut watermelon that was hidden there from the start."
0427-1,"The man used a mirror illusion.

*   **Explanation:** He placed a mirror flat on the table. He then took a watermelon that was already cut in half and placed the cut side down onto the mirror. The reflection of the half watermelon in the mirror created the appearance of a whole watermelon. The cutting motion was simulated, and he simply lifted the actual half he had placed down."
0427-2,"No, the man did not use video editing to create the illusion.

The illusion was created practically using a mirror placed flat on the table. When the man cut the watermelon and placed the bottom half on the mirror, the reflection completed the image, making it look like a whole watermelon when the top half was put back on. When he lifted the top half, the reflection of the bottom half still created the appearance of a whole watermelon momentarily."
0427-3,"No, the man did not achieve the trick by hollowing out a watermelon rind and placing a peeled watermelon inside.

**Explanation:** The trick is an optical illusion created using a mirror placed horizontally on the stand. The man holds half of a pre-cut watermelon above the mirror. The reflection of this half in the mirror creates the appearance of a whole, cut watermelon. When he pretends to cut, he is simply lowering the half watermelon towards the mirror surface."

0430-0,"The damage to the phone is not real; it is a staged visual effect.

**Explanation:** The video shows impossibly fast charging speeds, followed by dramatic cracking and freezing. Later, a similar sequence is performed on another phone, which is then revealed to be a prop with a ""FAKE"" sticker inside. This indicates the apparent damage is a special effect or part of a prop, triggered by the cranking action for the video, rather than actual damage caused by the device."
0430-1,"The phone appeared damaged after being connected to a hand-crank device that simulated an extreme and rapid overcharge.

**Explanation:** The video shows the crank being turned, the charge percentage skyrocketing unrealistically (e.g., 6000%), followed immediately by smoke/vapor and the screen appearing shattered. While this is the *depicted* cause, a later segment reveals a similar event using a phone explicitly marked ""FAKE,"" strongly suggesting the damage shown was a staged special effect for entertainment, not genuine electrical failure caused by the device."
0430-2,"**No**, the damage was not just a result of video editing effects.

While video editing was clearly used to create the impossible charging speed and percentage display, the physical shattering of the phone screen appears to be a practical effect, likely performed on a prop phone. This is strongly suggested by the second part of the video where a similar sequence occurs, and the broken phone is revealed to have a ""FAKE"" sticker underneath when the back comes off."
0430-3,"**No**, the phone did not get damaged because it was overcharged with the hand-crank charger.

**Explanation:** The video depicts an unrealistic scenario. Hand-crank chargers produce very low power, making it impossible to charge a phone at the depicted speed (reaching percentages like 6000%) or deliver enough energy to cause such catastrophic, instantaneous damage. Modern phones also have built-in protections against overcharging. The rapid charging animation, smoke effect, and sudden screen cracking are theatrical effects, indicating the event was staged for entertainment, which is further suggested when the same effect is replicated on a phone revealed to be ""FAKE""."

**Explanation:** After the first target (an orange clay pigeon launched by the woman) is shot, the man ejects the spent shotgun shell. He then tosses this ejected shell into the air and shoots it. He repeats this action, throwing the spent shells up himself for the subsequent shots."
0432-1,"The last few targets in the video are the **spent shotgun shell casings**.

**Explanation:** After shooting the initial orange clay pigeon, the shooter rapidly cycles the pump-action shotgun. Each time he cycles the action, the empty shell casing from the previous shot is ejected upwards and outwards from the firearm. He then quickly aims and shoots these ejected casings in mid-air before they hit the ground. This is a form of exhibition or trick shooting."
0432-2,"Yes, the last few targets in the video are spent shotgun shells thrown by the man.

**Explanation:** After shooting the initial clay target, the man ejects the spent shotgun shell from his pump-action shotgun. He then catches the ejected shell, throws it into the air, and shoots it. He repeats this action for the subsequent shots shown."
0432-3,"No, the last targets were not thrown by the person next to the shooter.

The video shows the woman next to the shooter throwing the first orange clay target. After shooting that target, the shooter proceeds to eject the spent shell casings, toss them into the air himself, and then shoot them in rapid succession."

0435-0,"All five swings performed by the man successfully cut the target made of bundled straw mats.

*   **Swing 1:** An upward diagonal cut from a kneeling position severed the top bundle.
*   **Swing 2:** A downward diagonal cut after standing severed the second bundle.
*   **Swing 3:** A horizontal cut severed the third bundle.
*   **Swing 4:** Another horizontal cut severed the fourth bundle.
*   **Swing 5:** A final downward diagonal cut severed the remaining piece of the bottom bundle.

Each swing resulted in a clean separation of a section of the straw target."
0435-1,"All four sword swings shown successfully hit the straw mat target. Each swing resulted in a clean cut, severing a distinct section of the straw bundle."
0435-2,"Yes, the man's first sword swing hit the target made of bundled straw mats. The video shows him drawing the sword and immediately executing a downward diagonal cut which cleanly severs the top bundle of the straw target."
0435-3,"Yes, the man's sword cut through a section of the straw mat target with every swing.

The video shows the man performing five distinct swings with his sword, and each swing successfully severs one of the five sections of the straw target, causing it to fall away."
0435-7,E
0439-0,The man does not light anything in the video. The video begins with a bundle of blue candles already lit and burning in a tray of water.
0439-1,"The man ignites a cluster of blue candles.

**Explanation:** The video shows the man setting fire to the wicks on top of several blue, cylindrical objects grouped together on a white base. He also explicitly refers to these items as ""candles"" when explaining the experiment."
0439-2,"No, the man does not light the pile of thin candles in the video. The video begins with the candles already lit and burning."
0439-3,"No, the man does not light the object that looks like a stack of matches in the video. The object is already lit and burning with a flame from the beginning of the clip."
0439-7,B
0441-0,"The state of action of the muscular man's left and right legs throughout the run is **alternating action** involving **opposing movements**.

**Explanation:** The legs continuously alternate their roles. While one leg is pushing off the ground (extending backward at the hip, flexing/extending at the knee and ankle) to propel the body forward (propulsion phase), the other leg is swinging forward (flexing at the hip and knee) to prepare for the next landing and push-off (swing/recovery phase). This coordinated, asynchronous cycle repeats for each leg, enabling continuous running."
0441-1,"The man's legs are in a state of dynamic motion, performing an exaggerated running style.

**Explanation:** His legs are actively pumping with a noticeable high knee lift and remain significantly bent throughout the stride. This creates a bouncy, somewhat choppy movement as part of his imitation of the ""Flint Lockwood run,"" with his leg muscles visibly engaged to propel him forward."
0441-2,"The muscular man is actually running.

The second part of the video shows a wider angle where he is clearly moving forward and covering distance across the pavement while being filmed."
0441-3,"No, the muscular man's running style does not involve high knee lifts or a pronounced forward thrust.

**Explanation:** In the clip showing his actual running (""What they see""), his knees remain relatively low, and his stride is more of a shuffle or jog rather than a powerful sprint. While he leans forward, it isn't the pronounced thrust associated with high-speed running; his movement appears somewhat restricted."
0441-7,C
0452-0,"**Left Leg Characteristic:** Like Messi's left leg.
*   **Explanation:** According to the text overlay in the video, the man wished for and received Messi's left leg from a genie. This implies characteristics associated with Messi's left foot, such as agility, finesse, and dribbling skill.

**Right Leg Characteristic:** Like Ronaldo's right leg.
*   **Explanation:** The same text overlay states the man also wished for and received Ronaldo's right leg. This implies characteristics associated with Ronaldo's right foot, such as power, speed, and shooting ability."
0452-1,"According to the meme's fictional premise, the dancer's left leg is Messi's and the right leg is Ronaldo's, implying a condition of possessing their legendary football skills.

Visually, both legs appear to be in excellent physical condition. They are strong, agile, flexible, and highly coordinated, enabling the dancer to execute demanding breakdancing maneuvers without any sign of injury or impairment."
0452-2,"**No**, the dancer's left leg is not disabled. The video shows the dancer performing complex and athletic breakdancing moves that require significant strength, coordination, and full function in both legs. The text overlay is a humorous meme suggesting the dancer possesses the legendary football skills of Messi's left leg and Ronaldo's right leg, implying enhanced ability rather than a disability."
0452-3,"**No.**

The dancer performs breakdancing footwork which requires and demonstrates agility, speed, and coordination in **both** legs. While the meme humorously suggests a combination of Messi's left-leg agility and Ronaldo's right-leg power, the actual movements in the video show the dancer using both legs for quick, intricate, and agile steps typical of the dance style, rather than a distinct functional split between agility in the left and power in the right."
0452-7,C
0456-0,"The man used 6 nails in the experiment.

He placed three rusty nails into one mug (for the Monster energy drink) and three rusty nails into a second mug (for the white vinegar)."
0456-1,"The man used a total of 6 nails in his experiment.

He placed three rusty nails into one glass mug and another three rusty nails into a second glass mug."
0456-2,"Yes, the man used six railroad spikes in the experiment, placing three in each cup. The video shows him picking up two handfuls of three spikes each and putting three into the left mug and three into the right mug."
0456-3,"No, the man did not use 14 nails with seven in each mug.

He used a total of 7 large railroad spikes. He placed four spikes into the left mug and three spikes into the right mug."
0456-7,D
0463-0,"The counter starts counting from the very first throw shown after the ""BASKET COUNTER"" graphic appears on screen.

**Explanation:** The graphic with five empty circles is displayed, and the immediately following throw attempt results in the first circle being marked (with a red 'X' for a miss), indicating the count began with that specific throw."
0463-1,"The counter begins to count successful baskets from the **third throw**.

**Explanation:** The counter graphic tracks the outcome of each throw from the beginning. The first two throws are misses and are marked with red X's. The third throw is the first successful basket, and it's marked with a green checkmark, initiating the count of made shots."
0463-2,"No, the counter does not start counting from the second throw. It begins counting from the very first throw made by the man, marking its outcome (a miss) before the second throw is attempted."
0463-3,"No, the counter does not start counting from the throw where the first successful basket is made.

**Explanation:** The counter begins tracking from the very first throw attempt shown in the video. It marks the first two throws as misses (indicated by red 'X's) before marking the third throw, which is the first successful basket, as a make (indicated by a green '✓'). This shows the counter records all attempts sequentially from the start, not just from the first success."

0466-0,"There are 7 optical illusion images shown in the video.

These images utilize clever perspective and/or precise timing to create illusions, such as a man appearing to fly on a broomstick, a giant seagull next to a tiny person, an airplane creating ""cat ears"" on the sun, an ant lifting a large log, a person putting the sun in someone's mouth, a flock of birds forming a dolphin shape, and the Statue of Liberty appearing to have smoke coming from its torch due to an airplane contrail."
0466-1,"There are **7** images featuring optical illusions in the video.

Each image uses techniques like forced perspective, perfect timing/alignment, or showcases natural phenomena (pareidolia) to create a visual effect that tricks the eye or misrepresents scale and reality."
0466-2,"Yes, the video contains 6 images that are related to optical illusions. In fact, it contains 7 images, all of which rely on optical illusions, primarily forced perspective or perfect timing, to create their effect.

1.  **Man on Broomstick:** Forced perspective makes the man appear to be flying near the house.
2.  **Giant Seagull:** Forced perspective makes the seagull look enormous compared to the tiny man.
3.  **Airplane and Sun:** Perfect timing makes the sun appear to have ""cat ears"" from the plane's exhaust.
4.  **Ant Lifting Twig:** Perfect timing and perspective make the ant appear to be lifting the twig against the backdrop of the sun.
5.  **Eating the Sun:** Forced perspective makes it look like one person is placing the sun into another person's mouth.
6.  **Bird Murmuration Dolphin:** Pareidolia causes viewers to see a dolphin shape in the pattern of the flock of birds.
7.  **Statue of Liberty Contrail:** Perfect timing makes an airplane contrail appear to be coming from the Statue of Liberty's torch.

Since the video contains 7 images based on optical illusions, it does contain 6 such images."
0466-3,"No, there are not 5 optical illusion images shown in the video. There are 7 images shown, all of which use optical illusions, forced perspective, or perfect timing to create their effect."
0466-7,D
0468-0,"The second person shown in the video successfully walked down the stairs.

**Explanation:** The video shows two attempts. The first person, wearing polka dot socks on grey carpet, stumbles and falls. The second person, wearing black socks on beige carpet, manages to walk down the entire staircase despite the disorienting visual effect."
0468-1,"The second person shown in the video was able to walk down the stairs successfully.

**Explanation:** The video shows two attempts. The first person (wearing polka dot socks on grey carpet) stumbles and falls. The second person (wearing black socks on beige carpet), shown in the latter part of the video, walks down the entire flight of stairs steadily and reaches the bottom without falling."
0468-2,"**Yes**, the second person successfully walked down the stairs despite the whirlpool effect. The video shows them navigating the steps from partway down and reaching the bottom landing without falling or stumbling."
0468-3,"No, the first person was not able to successfully walk down the stairs. The video shows them becoming disoriented by the whirlpool visual effect, stumbling after a few steps, and then the clip cuts abruptly with a sound that implies they fell."
0468-7,C
0494-0,"One kind of scissors was used in the video.

Explanation: The video clearly shows only a single pair of scissors being used to cut the paper spiral."
0494-1,**1**: The video only shows one pair of standard household scissors being used to cut the paper spiral.
0494-2,"**No**, two kinds of scissors were not used in the video. The video clearly shows only one pair of scissors being used to cut the spiral shape from the paper at the beginning."
0494-3,"No, only one kind of scissors was used in the video. These were used at the beginning to cut the paper spiral. A different tool, resembling pliers or wire cutters, was used later to cut the wooden stick."

0500-0,"There are three ping-pong balls shown in the video. One white ball is hit between two candles (0:11), one orange ball lands on a dart (0:13), and another orange ball lands in a container after knocking off a tile (0:20)."
0500-1,"**Answer:** 2.
**Explanation:** The video shows one white ping-pong ball being hit between two candles (0:11) and one orange ping-pong ball used in two separate trick shots (landing on a dart at 0:13 and falling into a container at 0:20)."
0500-2,"**No**, the video does not feature three ping-pong balls. It shows only two distinct ping-pong balls: one white ball used to extinguish candles and one orange ball used in two separate tricks (landing on a dart and landing in a container)."
0500-3,"No, there are not four ping-pong balls in the video. The video shows three separate clips where a single ping-pong ball is used for a trick shot (hitting it between candles, bouncing it onto a dart, and bouncing it into a bottle), but never four ping-pong balls at once or in total across the clips shown."
0500-7,A
0501-0,"There are five dumplings on the man's plate.

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows the man in the purple shirt carrying a tray with a plate that holds five dumplings. He sits down at the table with these five dumplings before he begins to eat."
0501-1,"There are 5 dumplings on the plate.

**Explanation:** The man wearing the purple shirt is shown carrying a tray with a plate that clearly holds five individual dumplings."

0512-0,"The ping-pong ball hit 4 pots at the beginning of the video. After rolling down the initial ramp, the ball bounced sequentially off the bottoms of four overturned black pots."
0512-1,The ping-pong ball bounced off **four** pots at the start of the video. It sequentially bounced off the bottom of four upside-down pots arranged in a descending path right after rolling off the initial metal track.
0512-2,"No, the ping-pong ball did not hit seven pots at the beginning of the video. It only hit the bottoms of four upside-down pots before moving to the next part of the machine."
0512-3,"**Answer:** No, the ping-pong ball hit more than two pots at the beginning of the video.

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows the ping-pong ball bouncing off the bottom of four separate pots in sequence before continuing its journey."
0512-7,B
0520-0,"The letters that require the minimum number of people (one person) in the video are:

*   **I:** Formed by one woman standing straight.
*   **V:** Formed by one woman sitting with legs raised in a V shape.
*   **W:** Formed by one woman lying down with arms and legs spread in a W shape.

These three letters only need a single person to create their shape, which is the minimum number used for any letter formation in the video."
0520-1,"The letters that require the fewest people to form are I, V, and W.

*   **I:** Formed by one woman standing straight.
*   **V:** Formed by one woman sitting and raising her legs into a V-shape.
*   **W:** Formed by one woman lying on her back, raising and positioning her arms and legs to create a W shape."
0520-2,"Yes, the letters 'I,' 'V,' and 'W' need only one person each to form in the video.

*   **I:** The letter 'I' (00:18) is formed by one woman standing straight.
*   **V:** The letter 'V' (00:47) is formed by one woman sitting and raising her legs.
*   **W:** The letter 'W' (00:49) is formed by one woman lying down and positioning her legs and arms."
0520-3,"No, the letter 'I' is not the only one that needs the minimum number of people to form. The minimum number of people used in the video to form a letter is one, and the letters 'I', 'V', and 'W' are all formed by a single person."

0522-0,"There are **two** men wearing hats seen in the video.

**Explanation:**
One man wears a distinctive pink unicorn/rhino-style helmet or hat throughout several scenes. Another man wears a grey baseball cap, visible in multiple group shots and a close-up."
0522-1,"There are **two** men wearing hats in the video.

**Explanation:** One man is seen wearing a pink unicorn/rhino-style helmet/hat, and another man is briefly seen wearing a grey baseball cap backwards while lying in the sand."
0522-2,"Yes, there are two men shown wearing hats in the video.

*   **Explanation:** One man is wearing a pink novelty hat/helmet (resembling a unicorn or rhino), and another man is wearing a grey baseball cap."
0522-3,"No, there are not three men shown wearing hats in the video.

**Explanation:** Only two men are seen wearing headgear in the video: one wears a pink unicorn/rhino-style helmet, and another briefly appears wearing a grey baseball cap backwards. The other men are bareheaded."

0525-0,"The person not in the wheelchair has two legs.

**Explanation:** The video shows a person running through the floodwater on two legs to assist the individual in the wheelchair."
0525-1,The person not in the wheelchair has two legs. This is visible as they run through the floodwater towards the person in the wheelchair.
0525-2,"No, the person not in the wheelchair has two legs. They can be seen running through the floodwater using both legs to reach and help the person in the wheelchair."
0525-3,"Yes, it is true that the person not in the wheelchair has two legs.

**Explanation:** The video shows the person running into the floodwater and wading through it using both legs to reach the individual in the wheelchair."
0525-7,B
0526-0,"The man is holding **two lighters**.

Explanation: In the second segment of the video (starting around 0:10), the man holds a standard orange lighter in one hand and a blue pen-shaped torch lighter in the other hand. He uses the orange lighter to ignite the blue torch lighter."
0526-1,"The man is holding **2** lighters.

He holds a standard disposable lighter in one hand and uses its flame to ignite a second object, shaped like a pen, in his other hand. Since the pen-shaped object also produces and sustains a flame, it functions as a second lighter."
0526-2,"Yes.
The man holds two different types of lighters: a standard orange lighter in his left hand and a blue pen-shaped torch lighter in his right hand."
0526-3,"No, the man is not holding three lighters in the second video segment. He is holding two lighters: one standard orange lighter in his left hand and one blue pen-shaped torch lighter in his right hand."
0526-7,B
0530-0,"The man in blue kicked the soccer ball that was being held up by the kneeling man. There were two balls present, one on the grass and one held aloft by the kneeling man; the man in blue kicked the elevated ball."
0530-1,"The man in blue kicked the soccer ball positioned further away from the kneeling man. This ball was on the left side from the camera's perspective and was the one set up directly in his path for the kick, while the kneeling man was adjusting the other ball."
0530-2,"No, the man in blue did not kick the middle ball. In that scene, another man is kneeling and holding the middle ball while the man in blue kicks the leftmost ball."
0530-3,"No, the man in blue did not kick the top ball. He kicked the bottom soccer ball, causing the top ball to fall straight down when its support was removed."

0539-0,"**5 people** were scared by the masked person while not in a car.

This includes a group of **four pedestrians** seen screaming and running away on the sidewalk, and **one mail carrier** who jumps back startled while standing outside her truck."
0539-1,"**5 individuals** were frightened outside of a car.

**Explanation:** The video shows a group of 4 pedestrians on a sidewalk who react with fear and run away (0:06-0:10), and later, 1 mail carrier standing beside her truck screams upon seeing the masked person (0:58-1:00)."
0539-2,"False. The video shows a group of four people walking on the sidewalk who are scared by the masked person, not six."
0539-3,False. The video shows five people not in cars being scared: a group of four pedestrians walking on the sidewalk and one mail carrier standing beside her truck.
0539-7,C
0541-0,"There are 12 teeth in the video.
This is because the video shows a drawing of a mouth on a piece of paper, and this drawing depicts 6 upper teeth and 6 lower teeth, totaling 12."
0541-1,"The total number of teeth shown throughout the video is **10**.

**Explanation:** The video displays a single drawing of a mouth containing 10 teeth (5 upper, 5 lower). Although the appearance of the teeth changes (spots appearing and disappearing) when the drawing is dipped in water, the actual number of teeth depicted remains constant at 10."
0541-2,"Yes, there are consistently 10 teeth visible in the drawing throughout the video. The black marks drawn on the teeth disappear when the drawing is submerged in water and reappear when lifted out, but the outlines of all 10 teeth remain visible from start to finish."
0541-3,"No, the number of visible teeth does not decrease to none. The teeth remain visible throughout the video; however, as the water level rises, the appearance of the teeth changes from having spots to being clean due to a second drawing becoming visible through the water."
0541-7,D
0542-0,"The scene shown as a metaphor for the passage of time occurs around the 0:49 mark. It depicts the person sitting calmly on rocks near the base of the waterfall.

**Explanation:** This scene is inserted between the moment the bread is placed in the covered pan over the fire (with coals on top) and the moment it is revealed as fully baked. By cutting away from the cooking process to show the person waiting patiently amidst the continuous, steady flow of the waterfall, the video visually represents the necessary time elapsing for the bread to bake. The constant movement of the water acts as a natural clock, signifying the duration of the unseen cooking process."
0542-1,"The scene of the person sitting by the waterfall (0:49) symbolizes the passage of time during the bread's cooking process. This brief, tranquil shot is placed between the action of covering the pan with hot coals to bake the bread and the action of removing the coals, visually representing the waiting period required for cooking."
0542-2,"Yes, the scene where the person sits under the waterfall likely serves as a visual representation or metaphor for the passage of time while the stromboli bakes.

**Explanation:** The scene is inserted directly between the point where the stromboli is placed in the cast iron pan with coals on top (beginning the baking process) and the point where the coals are removed and the cooked stromboli is revealed. This placement strongly suggests the waterfall scene is used creatively to signify the waiting period required for cooking, rather than simply showing the person waiting by the fire."
0542-3,"Yes, the scene where the person is bathing under a waterfall is used to represent the passage of time during the bread's cooking.

**Explanation:**

The video shows the stromboli being placed in the pan and covered with coals to bake over the fire. The scene then cuts to the person bathing under the waterfall. Immediately after this bathing scene, the video returns to the campfire where the coals are removed, revealing the cooked stromboli. This editing sequence uses the bathing scene as a visual shorthand to indicate that a period of time has passed, during which the baking process occurred. It shows an activity the person engaged in while waiting for the food to cook."
0542-7,D
0548-0,"The second thing the man clips with the car window is a **cucumber**.

Explanation: In the video segment (around 0:07-0:10), the man first holds a hotdog sausage against the window edge, then immediately replaces it with a cucumber, making the cucumber the second item shown in this sequence. He follows this with a carrot."
0548-1,"The second item the man clips with the car window is a **cucumber**.

In the video sequence, the man first holds a sausage up to the closing window, then he holds up a green cucumber, and finally, he holds up a carrot. Therefore, the cucumber is the second item."
0548-2,"Yes, the man did clip the cucumber with the car window after the sausage.

**Explanation:** The video shows the man in the car first holding up a sausage which gets clipped by the closing window. Immediately after, he holds up a cucumber, and the window closes again, clipping the cucumber."
0548-3,"No, the man does not clip a carrot as the second item with the car window. The video shows him clipping a sausage first, then a cucumber second, and finally a carrot third."
0548-7,B
0551-0,Both switches on the wall are in the down position. This usually indicates that they are in the 'off' state.
0551-1,"The switches are positioned horizontally, side-by-side on the wall.

**Explanation:** In the scene starting around 0:12, as the woman kneels on the floor, two round, white switches can be seen on the wall behind her and to her right. They are placed next to each other in a horizontal arrangement."
0551-2,"No, the switch is not in two different positions in the scene with the kneeling woman.

In the scene where the woman is kneeling on the floor (approximately 0:12 - 0:15), the light switch visible on the wall next to the door remains consistently in the down ('off') position."
0551-3,"No, the two round switches on the wall are not in the exact same rotational position. The left switch appears to be turned slightly further clockwise than the right switch."
0551-7,B
0552-0,"There are 6 slices of bread on the plate. This is because the plate holds three sandwiches, and each sandwich is made with two slices of bread."
0552-1,"There are four slices of bread on the plate held by the person in the kitchen. This is because the person flips two sandwiches from the pan onto the plate, and each sandwich consists of two slices of bread."
0552-2,"Yes, the person in the kitchen is carrying three pairs of sliced bread on the plate.

The video shows the person flipping three individual sandwiches from a pan onto the plate. Each sandwich is made using two slices of bread, which constitutes one pair. Therefore, three sandwiches equal three pairs of sliced bread."
0552-3,"No, the person is not carrying four slices of bread. They are carrying three sandwiches on the plate, which amounts to six slices of bread in total."
0552-7,D
0561-0,"The watch the man is wearing appears 8 times in the video. It is visible on his left wrist in each of the distinct time points shown as the dog grows (2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year, and 2 years)."
0561-1,"The man's watch appears in every time segment shown throughout the video. It is consistently visible on his left wrist in the photos taken at 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year, and 2 years."
0561-2,"No, the man's watch appears 8 times in the video. It is visible on his left wrist in each of the time segments shown: 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year, and 2 years."
0561-3,"No, the man's watch does not appear 10 times in the video.

**Explanation:** The video shows the man holding his dog at 8 distinct time points (2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year, and 2 years). The man is wearing a watch on his left wrist in each of these 8 segments. Therefore, the watch appears 8 times, not 10."
0561-7,C
0566-0,"Based on the visual narrative (as there is no explanatory narration), the scene with the broken pot of plant represents a mess or residue.

*   **Explanation:** The ad contrasts incomplete actions or messes (like the spilled soil) with cleaning actions (sweeping the soil). This specific scene serves as a visual metaphor for the incomplete cleaning sometimes left by using only toilet paper, suggesting that a further step (like using wipes, analogous to sweeping up the mess) is needed for a complete clean."
0566-1,"The purpose of showing the broken pot of plant is to serve as a visual metaphor for the residue or mess that needs cleaning after using the toilet. The act of sweeping the spilled dry soil is analogous to using only dry toilet paper, suggesting that this method might be incomplete and leave particles behind, thereby highlighting the need for a more thorough clean, which the advertised wipes provide."
0566-2,"Yes, the scenes with the broken pot of plant symbolize the mess and the ineffective cleaning process associated with using only rolled toilet paper in the context of the advertisement.

**Explanation:** The video juxtaposes scenes of various messes (like the spilled plant soil, a dump truck unloading, mud splashing) and attempts at cleaning them (sweeping the soil, wiping powder with dry paper) with the act of a woman using dry toilet paper. This visual analogy suggests that using only dry toilet paper is akin to these messy or less effective cleaning methods. The subsequent introduction of wet wipes is then presented as the more effective and cleaner solution, similar to how windshield wipers clear rain or water cleanses."
0566-3,"No, the scenes with the broken pot of plant do not highlight the effectiveness of Neve toilet paper and wipes in cleaning up messes.

**Explanation:** In the video, the mess from the broken pot, consisting of soil and plant debris, is shown being cleaned up using a brush and dustpan, not with either Neve toilet paper or Neve wipes. This scene, along with others depicting large-scale or difficult-to-clean messes (like the dump truck or muddy car), serves as a visual metaphor. It contrasts incomplete or inadequate cleaning methods with the thorough clean the advertisement suggests is achieved by using Neve toilet paper followed by Neve wipes. The effectiveness of the Neve products is demonstrated in separate scenes, such as cleaning up spilled makeup powder or wiping a surface clean."
0566-7,B
0567-0,"The hair color of the third person in the video is **black**.

This person is the woman who appears after the initial clips of the men with cereal; she is shown preparing healthy, homemade snacks from fruit and yogurt."
0567-1,"The third individual shown in the video, a woman preparing and distributing food, has long, black hair."
0567-2,"Yes, the third person shown in the video is the woman with long, straight black hair. She appears after the first two men and is shown preparing healthy fruit snacks and yogurt."
0567-3,"No, the third person in the video is a woman with long, dark hair who is shown preparing healthy food snacks. The person with blonde hair and dark roots is the first man shown in the video pouring a large amount of cereal."

0571-0,The ring is worn on the ring finger of the man's right hand. This is visible throughout the video as he holds and manipulates the different optical illusion objects.
0571-1,"The man is wearing a ring on his **right ring finger**. This is visible throughout the video as he handles the different optical illusion objects, particularly noticeable when he holds the Penrose triangle and the Asher cube."
0571-2,"No, the man's ring is not worn on the middle finger of his left hand. The ring is clearly visible on the ring finger of his right hand throughout the video."
0571-3,"Yes, the man's ring is worn on the ring finger of his right hand in the video.

**Explanation:** Throughout the video, as the man handles the different optical illusion objects, his right hand is clearly visible, and a ring can be seen consistently on his right ring finger."

0575-0,"The two items the little girl is wearing on her feet are **pink flip-flops**.

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows the child wearing one pink flip-flop on her left foot and one pink flip-flop on her right foot while standing on the driveway."
0575-1,"The little girl is wearing two pink flip-flops on her feet. One pink flip-flop is on her left foot, and the other matching pink flip-flop is on her right foot."
0575-2,"No, the items on the little girl's feet are two actual pink slippers. The phone, which was inside a pink slipper-shaped case, was found underneath the slipper she was wearing on her right foot, not worn *on* her foot as footwear."
0575-3,"Yes, both items on the little girl's feet are pink flip-flops. The video clearly shows her wearing matching pink flip-flops on both her left and right foot."
0575-7,D
0576-0,"The girl labeled ""GEN-Z"" uses a belt. She adds a black belt over her grey sweater to cinch her waist during the outfit assembly."
0576-1,"The woman styled as ""GEN-Z"" (on the right) is wearing a belt. She adds a black belt over her grey sweater as part of her outfit layering."
0576-2,"Yes, the GEN-Z girl is the one using a belt in the video.

*   **Explanation:** The video shows two identical women side-by-side, labeled ""millennial"" and ""GEN-Z"". The woman labeled ""GEN-Z"" (on the right) picks up a black belt and puts it on over her grey sweater and black skirt/dress as part of her outfit styling."
0576-3,"No, the millennial girl is not the one using a belt. The video shows the girl representing GEN-Z adding a black belt over her grey sweater, while the millennial girl layers a grey cardigan without a belt."
0576-7,D
0578-0,"**7 people:** The video features the parkour performer (1), Mr. Bean (1), the main construction worker operating the lift (1), a second construction worker briefly visible on the rooftop (1), and at least three other individuals seen walking in the background during the alleyway scene (3)."
0578-1,"**7**

There are 7 individuals shown in the video:
1.  The man performing parkour (in the grey suit).
2.  Mr. Bean (in the blue suit).
3.  A construction worker Mr. Bean interacts with on the roof.
4.  A second construction worker visible in the background on the roof.
5.  Three people walking in the background alley during the final scene."
0578-2,"No. The video shows several different scenes, primarily featuring two main characters involved in chase sequences across rooftops and through an alley. While some background figures like construction workers or pedestrians appear briefly, the maximum number of people visible simultaneously in any single shot does not reach eight; the highest count appears to be around six individuals in the alley scene."
0578-3,"Yes, there could be at least ten people in the video.

**Explanation:** While the initial rooftop scenes primarily feature two main characters and a few construction workers, the final chase sequence (around 0:55-0:57) shows the characters running through a populated alleyway where several other background individuals are clearly visible. Counting the main characters, the workers, and the background people brings the total number of individuals shown throughout the compilation to at least ten."

0580-0,"The girl ran **4 steps** before she reached the top.

Explanation: She takes four distinct steps on the surface of the warped wall (right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot) to gain upward momentum before jumping to grab the top edge."
0580-1,The girl took 4 steps before reaching the top of the wall. She takes two steps with her right foot and two steps with her left foot on the ramp's surface before grabbing the top edge.
0580-2,"Yes, the girl ran four steps before she reached the top. She takes four distinct steps on the surface of the warped wall (right, left, right, left) before grabbing the top edge."
0580-3,"No, the girl did not run five steps before reaching the top. She took three steps on the ramp itself before jumping and grabbing the edge."
0580-7,C
0588-0,"There are four drawers on the table with the globe. The white dresser shown in the video has two drawers on the left side and two drawers on the right side, making a total of four."
0588-1,"There are four drawers on the desk with the globe on top.

**Explanation:** The video shows a white dresser with a globe on it. This dresser has two columns, each containing two drawers (a smaller one above a larger one), making a total of four drawers."
0588-2,"Based on the video, the desk with the globe does not have five drawers; it has four drawers.

**Explanation:**
At approximately the 0:07 mark, the video shows a white dresser with a globe on top. This dresser has four drawers, arranged in two columns of two."
0588-3,"Yes, it is true that the desk (which appears to be a dresser) with the globe has four drawers. The video shows the white piece of furniture has two smaller drawers across the top and two larger drawers below them."
0588-7,A
0589-0,"No, the person in the video did not eat all the chocolate in six hours. The video shows a timestamp of ""6 hours,"" and at that point, there is still a substantial amount of chocolate left in the tank, and the person is still eating."
0589-1,"No, the individual did not consume all the chocolate within a six-hour period. The video includes a timer overlay, and at the 6-hour mark, a large quantity of chocolate bars is still visible inside the tank."
0589-2,"Yes, more than half of the chocolate was still uneaten at the six-hour mark in the video. The timestamp ""6 hours"" appears while the man is still eating, and the level of chocolate remaining in the tank is visibly well above the halfway point."
0589-3,"No, the video did not show that it took 12 hours for the person to finish the chocolate.

The video shows time markers up to 6 hours for the chocolate eating challenge. The 12-hour completion time shown later in the video refers to a separate challenge where the person drinks coconut water from the tank using a fork."
0589-7,A
0590-0,"At the end of the video, the man in the black jacket screamed because the man in the red shirt placed a large, fake spider toy directly onto his forehead while he was lying on the ground. This sudden placement of the spider startled him, causing him to scream."
0590-1,"The man in the black jacket screamed because the man in the red sweater placed a large, fake spider directly onto his face while he was lying on the floor at the bottom of the stairs. This was the final action in a chase sequence where the man in red had set various traps for the man in black."
0590-2,"Yes, the man in the black jacket screamed because the man in the red sweater placed a large, hairy spider toy directly onto his face while he was lying incapacitated at the bottom of the stairs."
0590-3,"No, the man in the black jacket did not scream because he stepped on a spider.

**Explanation:** The video shows the man in the black jacket lying incapacitated on the floor at the bottom of the stairs. The man in the red sweater then deliberately places a fake spider prop onto his face, causing him to scream in shock or fear. He did not step on it."
0590-7,B
0595-0,"The boy in the video, Michiel, scored with all three items he attempted:

1.  A large blue exercise ball.
2.  A soccer ball.
3.  A tennis ball.

He successfully threw each of these items into the goal net, as indicated by the green checkmarks appearing next to the corresponding icons under his name after each successful throw."
0595-1,"The boy, Michiel, used three types of balls to score in the video:

1.  **A large blue exercise ball:** He successfully kicked this ball into the goal first.
2.  **A soccer ball:** He then scored by kicking the soccer ball into the goal.
3.  **A tennis ball:** Finally, he successfully threw the tennis ball into the goal.

He scored with all three types of balls assigned to him in the challenge, as indicated by the green checkmarks appearing next to each ball icon under his name after each successful attempt."
0595-2,"Yes, the boy scored with all three balls in the video. He successfully kicked the blue exercise ball into the net, threw the soccer ball into the net, and threw the tennis ball into the net during his turns. The scoreboard graphic updates with a green checkmark after each of his successful attempts."
0595-3,"No, the boy did not score with a basketball, volleyball, or baseball.

Explanation: The video shows the boy (Michiel) successfully scoring goals with a large blue exercise ball, a soccer ball, and a tennis ball, as indicated by the icons next to his name in the challenge."
0595-7,D
0597-0,"Based on the video, here are the key characteristics of the person holding the camera:

1.  **Mobile and Physically Fit:** The camera operator is constantly running alongside the actors in each skit to keep pace and capture the action. *Explanation: The smooth tracking shots that follow the running actors across various outdoor locations demonstrate the operator's own movement and stamina.*
2.  **Skilled in Handheld Filming:** They manage to keep the subjects relatively well-framed and the footage reasonably stable despite the continuous running motion. *Explanation: While there is inherent movement due to running, the actors remain the central focus and the shot doesn't become excessively shaky, indicating good camera control.*
3.  **Collaborative:** The cameraperson is clearly working in tandem with the actors, following their choreographed actions for each profession's portrayal. *Explanation: The coordinated movement and consistent filming style across different skits suggest the camera operator is an integral part of the planned performance.*
4.  **Maintains Close Proximity:** The camera stays close to the actors, providing a dynamic and engaging perspective of the action. *Explanation: The framing often captures the actors from the waist up or full body but from a near distance, immersing the viewer directly into the scene.*"
0597-1,"The person operating the camera is actively running alongside or behind the actors to capture the action. They remain unseen throughout the video but are clearly physically capable of moving at pace while maintaining focus and framing on the subjects, creating a dynamic, close-up perspective for the viewer."
0597-2,"Yes, the person holding the camera is wearing white sneakers and what appears to be a light gray jacket or sweatshirt. This is most clearly visible during the ""Photographer"" scene around the 0:18 mark."
0597-3,"**Answer:** No, it is impossible to determine what the person holding the camera is wearing.

**Explanation:** The video is filmed from a first-person perspective, meaning we see the scene through the eyes of the camera operator. The person holding the camera is never shown on screen, so their clothing cannot be seen or confirmed."
0597-7,D
0600-0,"**Answer:** The orange ball did not hit the boy in the video.
*   **Explanation:** The video shows the boy attempting to balance on a soccer ball near the stationary orange ball. He loses his balance and falls, but the orange ball remains on the ground and does not make contact with him at any point."
0600-1,"The orange ball made contact with the boy's right foot.

**Explanation:** In the video, around the 0:09-0:10 mark, the boy runs towards the stationary large orange ball and kicks it forward using his right foot. This is the only point of contact shown between the boy and the orange ball."
0600-2,"No, the orange ball did not hit the boy on his head. The orange ball remained stationary on the ground near the boy throughout the video."
0600-3,"**No**, the orange ball did not hit the boy on his back. The video shows the boy losing balance while standing on a soccer ball and falling backward onto the grass, landing beside the orange ball without it making contact with his back."
0600-7,A
0603-0,"Based on the video, the person who reached two failures first (though not consecutively) and lost a heart as a result of the second failure has the following characteristics:

*   **Attire:** Wears a red t-shirt with a white circular 'M' logo, black pants ripped at the knees, and has bright red hair (or headwear).
*   **Association:** Competes within the pink hula hoop and their score is represented by red, pixelated hearts.
*   **Action Leading to Second Failure:** Attempted a backflip but failed to land inside the designated pink hoop (at 0:16).
*   **Consequence:** Following this second failure, the opponent popped the red balloon, causing one of the red heart icons to disappear, reducing their score from two hearts to one (0:21-0:22)."
0603-1,"The person who failed twice in a row and lost a heart is characterized by the following features:

*   **Outfit:** Wears a red t-shirt featuring a white circle logo with a white 'M' inside, black pants with ripped knees, and sneakers.
*   **Appearance:** Has red-dyed hair, a red bandana tied around the forehead, and a dark beard.
*   **Game Elements:** Is associated with the red pixelated hearts (representing lives or score) on the left side and stands within a pink hoop.
*   **Actions:** Attempted backflips, failed to land cleanly within the hoop on two consecutive tries (at approximately 0:01-0:02 and 0:16-0:18), and subsequently lost one red heart when the opponent popped the red balloon (0:21-0:22). He reacted with frustration after the second failed attempt."
0603-2,"Yes, the person wearing the blue shirt and dark blue pants failed twice in a row. He failed his attempts at 0:31 and again at 0:41, losing hearts during this sequence of play."
0603-3,"**No.**

The person wearing the red shirt with a white 'M' logo and standing in the pink hula hoop failed twice (at 0:02 and 0:18), but these failures were not consecutive as they successfully landed a move in between (at 0:10). The person who failed twice in a row (at 0:32 and 0:42) was the one wearing the blue shirt and standing in the blue hula hoop."
0603-7,C
0607-0,"At the end of the video, the man is falling from the ceiling. This occurs because the suction device attached to his left foot loses its grip and detaches, causing him to lose support and begin falling towards the floor."
0607-1,"The man is hanging upside down from the ceiling.

**Explanation:** His feet are attached to the ceiling using specialized gear, holding his body inverted against gravity with his head pointing towards the floor. The basketball falling away from him towards the floor confirms this orientation."
0607-2,"No, the man is not standing on the ground made to look like a ceiling. He is hanging upside down from the actual ceiling, attached by devices on his feet. This is confirmed by the normal orientation of the room's furniture on the floor below him and by the fact that the basketball falls downwards towards the floor when he releases it, following the natural direction of gravity."
0607-3,"No, the man is not standing on the ceiling. He is hanging upside down, attached to the ceiling by equipment on his feet. Standing involves supporting one's weight upright on a surface below, whereas this man's body hangs below the point of attachment due to gravity."
0607-7,C
0609-0,"A spinning red ball is used to determine who should be eliminated.

**Explanation:** The participants spin the red ball in the center of the table. The person the ball is facing or closest to when it stops spinning is the one who is eliminated from the game."
0609-1,"**Answer:** Elimination is decided when the ball falls off the edge of the table.

*   **Explanation:** The video shows players sitting around a table, pushing a red ball. When the ball rolls off the edge of the table, the player closest to that edge is eliminated from the game."
0609-2,"**Yes**, the elimination is based on whether participants move their hands while the ball is still held.

**Explanation:** The video shows participants placing their hands on the table around a central ball held by one person. The participants get eliminated when they lift their hands off the table *before* the person holding the ball actually lifts it, often reacting prematurely to feints or slight movements made by the holder. The objective is to react only *after* the ball is genuinely lifted."
0609-3,"No, elimination is not determined by who is holding the ball when it stops.

**Explanation:** The players in the video are seen pushing or sliding the ball across the table, not holding it. Elimination appears to occur for the player in front of whom the ball comes to a complete stop. The objective seems to be to push the ball away before it stops moving in your area."
0609-7,C
0610-0,"The woman throws the package out of the window because the video clip is being played in reverse.

In the original sequence (played forward), the men likely took the package from her inside the house and ran outside to mail it. When the footage is reversed, it appears as though the men are running towards the house and catching the package that she throws out the window, effectively showing the ""un-mailing"" process consistent with the reversed theme of the entire video."
0610-1,"The woman tossed the package out of the window as a quick and unconventional way to delegate the task of mailing it to her two hyper-efficient assistants. Consistent with the video's theme of exaggeratedly fast service, she expected them to immediately retrieve the package outside and handle its delivery, which they promptly did by running off with it."
0610-2,"Yes, the woman threw the package out of the window so the two men could help her put it in the mailbox.

**Explanation:** The video shows the woman addressing a package near an open window. After addressing it, she tosses the package outside. The two men immediately run out, pick up the package, and run down the driveway towards the street, which is where a mailbox is typically located, indicating they are taking it to be mailed."
0610-3,"No, the woman was not trying to get rid of the package in the sense of discarding it.

**Explanation:** The video shows two men waiting outside the window who immediately catch the package after she throws it and then run off with it. This indicates she was using an expedited, albeit humorous, method to have the package sent or delivered by them, consistent with the theme of the men providing extremely fast service throughout the video."
0610-7,B
0612-0,"According to the video, the paper is divided into two parts to visually compare the results of creating the same artwork using two vastly different sets of materials: one side uses unconventional items costing effectively $0 (like burnt matches, coffee, grass), while the other side uses professional colored pencils costing $300. This division allows for a direct, side-by-side comparison of the techniques, quality, and final appearance achievable with free versus expensive art supplies."
0612-1,"The paper is divided into two sections to create a direct side-by-side comparison between two different sets of coloring materials applied to the same drawing.

**Explanation:** The left side, labeled ""$0 Pencils,"" is colored using unconventional, free materials found objects like burnt matches, coffee, grass, candy, and toothpaste. The right side, labeled ""$300 Pencils,"" is colored using traditional, expensive colored pencils. This division allows the viewer to clearly see and contrast the results, textures, and colors achievable with each method."
0612-2,"Yes, the purpose of dividing the paper is to compare the results of using $0 ""pencils"" (non-traditional, found materials) with $300 traditional colored pencils.

The video clearly labels the left side ""$0 Pencils"" and shows the artist using items like burnt matches, coffee, grass, candy, toothpaste, and berries to color that side. The right side is labeled ""$300 Pencils"" and shows the artist using actual colored pencils. The split down the middle creates a direct visual comparison between the two methods and their outcomes on the same drawing."
0612-3,"**No**, the division is for comparison, but the '$0 pencils' side specifically utilizes unconventional materials like burnt matches, coffee, and grass as drawing and coloring tools, rather than having no specific tools. The comparison contrasts these free/found materials used as tools against the expensive ($300) colored pencils."
0612-7,D
0614-0,"The man's hands are trembling likely because he is nervous or anxious. This could be due to anticipation of interacting with the waitress, whom he later gives a gift to, or it might be part of a staged performance for the video to portray this nervousness before the interaction."
0614-1,"The man's hands tremble likely due to nervousness or anxiety.

**Explanation:** The trembling is most noticeable as the waitress approaches and serves him. Given that he later interacts with her more directly and gives her a gift, the trembling appears to be a physical manifestation of nervousness, anticipation, or perhaps shyness related to interacting with her or executing his plan to give her the gift."
0614-2,"Yes, the man appears to be pretending his hands are trembling to see if anyone, specifically the waitress, will help him.

His hands shake severely while he attempts to pour juice and eat his salad, causing him to spill. However, the trembling stops completely and abruptly after the waitress kindly helps him eat and drink. He then smoothly reaches into his bag with steady hands to retrieve a box of chocolates as a gift for her, indicating the trembling was likely an act to test her kindness."
0614-3,"Yes, the man's trembling hands could very likely be due to nervousness or excitement, or a combination of both.

**Explanation:** The trembling is most noticeable as the waitress is near and just before he initiates the interaction to give her the gift (the Raffaello chocolates). Such social situations, especially those involving giving an unexpected gift or approaching someone potentially found attractive, often trigger the body's ""fight or flight"" response, leading to adrenaline release. This physiological reaction commonly manifests as physical symptoms like trembling hands, stemming from either anxiety about the outcome (nervousness) or anticipation of a positive result (excitement)."
0614-7,B
0616-0,"**Answer:** The white/cream ball reaches the finish line first.

*   **Explanation:** Although the blue and black balls start earlier, the white/cream ball, which starts last, navigates the obstacles and enters the final narrow channel at the end of the track ahead of the other two balls."
0616-1,"**The white ball crosses the finish line first.**

**Explanation:** Although the blue and black balls start earlier, the white ball, starting last from the center, takes a more direct and efficient path through the obstacles. This allows it to overtake the other two balls and enter the final narrow channel (the finish line) ahead of them."
0616-2,"**Yes**, the white ball is the first to reach the finish line in the video. Although it starts after the blue and black balls, it navigates the course faster and enters the final slot at the end before the other two."
0616-3,"No, the blue ball does not reach the finish line first. The white/yellowish ball, despite starting last, overtakes the blue ball and enters the finish slot before it."
0616-7,E
0620-0,"The man in the video is not standing. He is hanging upside down from the ceiling, attached by devices on his feet inside what appears to be a living room."
0620-1,"The man is hanging upside down from the ceiling.

**Explanation:** His feet are attached to the ceiling using specialized gear, holding his body inverted against gravity with his head pointing towards the floor. The basketball falling away from him towards the floor confirms this orientation."
0620-2,"**No**, the man is not standing on the ground made to look like a ceiling.

**Explanation:** The man is hanging upside down from the actual ceiling, using devices attached to his feet. This is evident because the room's furniture (couch, lamp), floor (rug), and ceiling fan are all oriented normally below him. Furthermore, gravity acts as expected: the basketball falls downwards towards the floor (where the hoop is), and one of the devices on his feet begins to detach, indicating it's holding his weight against gravity from the ceiling above."
0620-3,"No, the man is not standing on the ceiling. He is hanging upside down from the ceiling using equipment attached to his feet. His body is suspended below his feet due to gravity, which defines the position as hanging, not standing."
0620-7,B
0621-0,"**Left foot.**

All the individuals in the video lean towards their left side against the wall, causing their left foot to be the one positioned against the wall first."
0621-1,**Left Foot:** All individuals in the video place their left foot against the wall first as they initiate the backward lean.
0621-2,"No, the left foot is not the first one to lean against the wall. The video shows the boy on the far right (Mini Michiel) placing his right foot against the wall first for stability after leaning back."
0621-3,"No, the right foot is not the first one to lean against the wall. In the video, the individuals stand with their backs to the wall and attempt to lean forward. Their feet remain planted on the ground throughout this action; they do not lean their feet against the wall. The challenge involves maintaining balance while leaning forward with the wall restricting backward movement."
0621-7,B
0625-0,"The direction of displacement of the second ball is **leftward**.

**Explanation:** The second ball appears on the right side of the horizontal track that forms and immediately moves horizontally along that track towards the center of the oval shape."
0625-1,The second ball moves to the left. It appears on the right side within the horizontal groove and travels towards the center.
0625-2,"No, the second ball does not move back and forth along a horizontal groove. It moves only once along the horizontal groove, traveling from the right side to the left side, and then stops."
0625-3,"**No**, the second ball does not follow a circular path or move in a loop. It appears near the center and moves in a straight line horizontally along a groove towards the right edge of the circular area, where it stops."
0625-7,A
0627-0,"Both the **woman** behind the cutout and the **person filming** are changing their positions.

*   **The woman:** She shifts her body and leans slightly as the camera moves around the cardboard figure.
*   **The person filming:** They are actively moving around the room to capture different angles of the optical illusion, which is evident from the changing perspective of the shot."
0627-1,"Both the woman and the camera operator changed their position.

**Explanation:** The camera operator moved significantly around the cardboard cutout to demonstrate the optical illusion from various angles. The woman standing behind the cutout also made slight adjustments to her stance and pose as the camera moved."
0627-2,"No, the photographer is moving the camera, but this movement is primarily to demonstrate the optical illusion created by the cardboard cutout, not to physically change the position of the woman.

**Explanation:** The video showcases an optical illusion where the concave face of the cutout appears convex and seems to follow the viewer. The photographer moves the camera side-to-side to demonstrate this effect and how it breaks down from different angles. While the photographer's movement changes the perspective from which the woman is viewed relative to the cutout, it doesn't cause the woman herself to change her physical location in the room; she moves independently."
0627-3,"**No**, the woman in the video does not move to change the position of the ""other person,"" which is a stationary cardboard cutout. The woman moves around the fixed cutout, and the change in her viewing perspective creates an optical illusion (known as the hollow-face illusion) that makes the cutout's head appear to turn and follow her. The cutout itself does not physically change its location."
0627-7,A
0633-0,"The wheels of the black car turn forward at the end of the video. This is because the car is shown actively driving forward on the snow-covered road, which requires the wheels to rotate in a forward direction to propel the vehicle."
0633-1,"The wheels of the black car rotate **forward**.

**Explanation:** At the conclusion of the video (around 0:18-0:19), the black car is shown driving forward through the snow. For a vehicle to move forward, its wheels must rotate in the forward direction, propelling the car ahead."
0633-2,"Yes, the wheels of the black car turn forward at the end of the video.

**Explanation:** The final scene shows a close-up of the front wheel of the black car, equipped with red traction devices, rotating as the car moves forward through the snow. The direction of rotation is consistent with the car driving ahead."
0633-3,"No, the wheels of the black car are turning forward at the end of the video. This is evident as the car is shown driving forward through the snow, requiring forward wheel rotation to propel it."
0633-7,B
0643-0,"Based on the video, the wind appears to be blowing from the right towards the left.

*   **Explanation:** When the person on the right unfurls the Olympic flag, it billows out towards the left side of the screen, indicating the wind is pushing it in that direction."
0643-1,"You can determine the wind direction by observing the way the flag is blowing. In this video, the flag hangs relatively straight down with minimal movement after being unfurled, suggesting there was very little to no wind at that moment, making it difficult to determine a specific direction."
0643-2,"Yes, the wind appears to be blowing from the left to the right side of the screen. This is indicated by the way the Olympic flag, held by the person on the right, billows and moves towards the right as it is unfurled and held up."
0643-3,"Yes, the video shows the wind blowing from the right side of the screen to the left. This is evident as the Olympic flag, being handled by the soldier on the right, clearly billows and is pushed towards the left side of the frame."
0643-7,D
0645-0,"Relative to the camera perspective, the left end of the scarf worn by the student character is hanging down the front right side of her body at the end of the video.

**Explanation:**
At the start, the student holds the left end of the scarf (from the camera's view) in her left hand. She then wraps the scarf around her neck. This action brings the end initially held on the left across her body and lets it hang down on her front right side."
0645-1,"From the camera's perspective, the left end of the student's scarf ends up hanging down the right side of the student's torso.

**Explanation:** The student takes the end of the scarf initially held in her left hand (camera's left), wraps it around her neck, and lets it hang down her front. This final position places that end of the scarf on her own right side, which corresponds to the right side from the camera's viewpoint."
0645-2,
0645-3,"**No.** At the end of the video, the left end of the student's scarf (the end initially held in their left hand) is hanging down on their left side, over their left shoulder and chest area, not on their right side."
0645-7,B
0652-0,"After the spin, the car ended up facing the opposite direction, approximately 180 degrees from its original direction of travel. It also moved laterally across the lanes, coming to rest near the right edge or shoulder of the highway."
0652-1,"The car ended up stationary on the **right shoulder of the highway, facing the opposite direction of traffic flow.**

**Explanation:** After losing control in the left lane, the car spun across multiple lanes of traffic towards the right. It came to a complete stop off the main travel lanes, on the shoulder area adjacent to the rightmost lane, oriented roughly 180 degrees from its original direction of travel."
0652-2,"**No.** The car did end up in the innermost (leftmost) lane after the spin, but it came to a stop facing backwards, the opposite direction of traffic flow, not the correct direction."
0652-3,"**Answer:** No, the car did not end up facing the opposite direction on the highway after the spin.

**Explanation:** After losing control on the wet road and spinning multiple times, the car comes to a stop facing sideways, angled across the lanes towards the left side of the highway, rather than completely turned around 180 degrees opposite to its original direction of travel."

0655-0,"The truck and the camera are moving at approximately the same speed.

**Explanation:** The camera maintains a relatively stable position alongside the truck throughout the video clip in order to film it effectively. This indicates that neither the truck nor the vehicle carrying the camera is significantly faster than the other; they are traveling at very similar speeds."
0655-1,"The camera moves faster than the truck.

**Explanation:** While the vehicle carrying the camera might initially be moving at a similar speed to the truck, the camera itself performs a very rapid pan (a quick horizontal rotation) to shift the view from the Batmobile to the truck's driver cabin near the end. This panning motion is visibly much faster than the truck's steady forward movement during that specific moment."
0655-2,"Yes, the camera is moving faster than the truck in the video.

Explanation: Initially, the camera appears to keep pace with the truck, filming the Batmobile on the flatbed. However, the camera then moves forward relative to the truck to reveal the driver's cabin. To achieve this forward movement alongside the moving truck, the vehicle carrying the camera had to be travelling at a higher speed than the truck itself during that part of the video."
0655-3,"No, the truck is not moving faster than the camera. The camera appears to be moving alongside the truck at a similar speed, maintaining a relatively consistent distance and framing throughout the video clip."

0658-0,"The racer in the darker clothing (black/grey top and black pants) is faster. They get a quicker start off the gate, immediately take the lead down the ramp, and maintain that lead over the initial jumps on the track."
0658-1,"The rider in the black gear is quicker. They get a faster start out of the gate, immediately pull ahead of the rider in the white gear, and extend their lead down the first straight."
0658-2,"**Yes**, the rider in the black outfit is the faster one during the race shown.

**Explanation:** Immediately after the starting gate drops, the rider in the black outfit accelerates more quickly, takes the lead down the starting ramp, and maintains a significant advantage over the other rider throughout the first straight section of the track."
0658-3,"No, the rider in the white outfit is not the faster one. The rider in the black outfit gets a quicker start from the gate and maintains a clear lead throughout the visible portion of the race down the track."

0664-0,The woman rolled the dice 10 times. This was counted by observing each instance she picked up and threw the dice onto the game board during her turn until she successfully shut the box.
0664-1,"The woman threw the dice 10 times. This is counted by observing each instance she picks up and rolls the dice during her turn in the video, starting from the first roll until her final winning roll."
0664-2,"No, the woman did not roll the dice 9 times during the game.

*   **Explanation:** By carefully counting each time the woman physically throws the dice into the box, she rolls them a total of 10 times throughout her turn shown in the video."
0664-3,"No, the woman did not roll the dice 11 times.

Based on the sequence shown in the video, she rolls the dice 10 times during her turn, culminating in her final roll where she closes the number 3 tile and wins the game."
0664-7,B
0667-0,"There are 6 people who participated in the challenge.

**Explanation:**
The video shows six different individuals taking turns dropping a red balloon from the upper level and then jumping down the stairs to attempt catching it before it touches the floor. While a seventh person is seen sitting on the stairs watching, they do not actively take a turn in the challenge."
0667-1,"There are **7** participants in total shown in the video. This includes the 6 individuals who take turns dropping the balloon and jumping down to try and catch it, plus the one individual sitting on the stairs observing the challenge."
0667-2,"Yes, there are six people participating in the challenge.

**Explanation:**
The video shows a challenge where six different individuals (Celine, Bram, Laura, Ise, Michiel, and Anna, as identified by on-screen text) each take a turn dropping a red balloon from an upper level and then attempting to run down the stairs to catch it before it touches the ground. While another person is visible watching from the stairs, only these six actively take part in the challenge."
0667-3,"No, there are not seven people participating in the challenge in the video.

A count of the individuals shown throughout the video confirms there are only six people involved: one person dropping the balloon from the upper level, four people watching or attempting to catch it on the lower level, and one person sitting and observing on the stairs."
0667-7,C
0670-0,"Three children jumped into the water in the video.

This is observed during the scene where the narrator joins a group of local children jumping off a floating dock; three distinct children are shown performing jumps or flips into the water."
0670-1,"**Three** children are explicitly shown jumping into the water from the dock in the video.

*   **Explanation:** During the sequence where the group is on the floating dock (around 0:11 to 0:27), one child performs a backflip, another jumps in feet first, and a third child also performs a backflip before the father attempts his jump and lands incorrectly."
0670-2,"No, it is not true that only two children jumped into the water in the video. The video shows several boys (referred to by the narrator as ""12 year olds"") jumping and flipping off a floating dock into the water, along with the adult man."
0670-3,"No, four children did not jump into the water in the video. The video shows three different children jumping into the water from the dock, along with the adult narrator who jumps twice."
0670-7,D
0673-0,"There are 3 buckets containing real popcorn shown in the video.

**Explanation:** Three people (two males in the back row, one female in the front row) are shown holding traditional yellow popcorn buckets filled with popcorn, which appears real. The fourth person (male with green hair) initially holds popcorn glued to a cardboard circle, revealing it's fake, and does not have a bucket initially."
0673-1,"**Three buckets contain actual popcorn.**

**Explanation:** The video shows four people in a movie theater setting. While four popcorn containers/items are initially visible, the person with green hair reveals that their ""popcorn"" is a fake prop glued to a surface. The other three individuals each have a standard yellow popcorn bucket filled with actual popcorn that they are seen eating."
0673-2,"Yes, there are two (and actually three) buckets of real popcorn shown in the video.

A girl sitting next to the person with green hair is eating from a bucket of real popcorn. Additionally, at least two other people sitting in the rows behind them are also shown eating from their own buckets of real popcorn."
0673-3,"**No**, there are not four buckets of real popcorn shown in the video.

**Explanation:** While there are four popcorn buckets visible, the person in the front left seat quickly reveals that their ""popcorn"" is actually a fake cardboard cutout hidden under a napkin. The other three people are shown eating real popcorn from their buckets."
0673-7,C
0675-0,"The man on the left felt playfully annoyed or mockingly accusatory. This is because after seeing the seemingly magical transformations (knife, pen, flower, thumb), the final reveal showed the AirPods were simply already in the other man's ears, exposing the ""magic"" as simple tricks and misdirection rather than genuine illusion. His pointing finger at the end emphasizes a lighthearted ""Aha! So that's how you tricked me!"" reaction."
0675-1,"The man on the left reacted with playful surprise and amusement each time the man on the right revealed how the magic tricks were performed.

**Explanation:** His reactions, characterized by wide eyes, smiles, and sometimes pointing (like with the AirPods), suggest he wasn't genuinely fooled into believing it was real magic. Instead, he appeared entertained and charmed by the simplicity and cleverness of the reveals, appreciating the explanation of how each illusion was achieved as part of their shared, lighthearted interaction."
0675-2,"Yes, the man on the left appeared displeased or at least mock-annoyed after the magic tricks were revealed.

**Explanation:** While initially laughing and smiling during the performance of the tricks, his expression consistently shifted to wide-eyed surprise, sometimes bordering on mock annoyance or exasperation (especially evident in his pointing gesture after the AirPods trick), once the simple mechanism behind each illusion was exposed by the younger man. This suggests his pleasure was in the illusion, and the reveal brought about surprise and a feeling of being playfully duped."
0675-3,"Yes, the man on the left felt impressed and intrigued after the magic tricks were explained.

His facial expressions consistently shifted from initial surprise or confusion during the illusion to amusement, smiles, and nods of understanding once the method was revealed. This indicates he found the explanations interesting and the tricks clever. For example, he laughs after seeing the retractable knife, smiles after the pen/pencil switch, and points with interest at the AirPods case mechanism."
0675-7,B
0679-0,"At the end of the video, the lady in the white tank top vest feels **shocked and surprised**.

**Explanation:** Her immediate reaction includes wide eyes, an open mouth, and stopping her action (eating), which are clear non-verbal cues indicating astonishment and disbelief at the unexpected and bizarre sight of the man walking away with the stool top stuck to him, leaving only the post behind."
0679-1,"The woman reacts with shock and surprise.

This is evident as her eyes widen significantly, her mouth drops open, and she abruptly stops eating, staring down at the empty space where the stool unexpectedly disappeared."
0679-2,"**Yes**, the woman in the white tank top feels surprised at the end of the video.

**Explanation:** Her eyes widen significantly and her mouth drops open in a classic expression of shock or surprise immediately after the man pulls the stool base away, leaving the seat seemingly balanced on its own. She stops eating and stares at the stool top, clearly taken aback by the unexpected event."
0679-3,"**No**, the woman in the white tank top does not appear upset or frustrated at the end of the video. Her immediate reaction, characterized by wide eyes and an open mouth directed towards where the man was, clearly indicates shock and surprise at the unexpected prank of him pulling the stool away, rather than frustration or anger."
0679-7,B
0689-0,"The man in the purple T-shirt changed the other man's lock screen wallpaper to his own photo as a playful prank.

*   **Explanation:** His actions, such as taking a funny selfie, quickly changing the wallpaper while the owner wasn't looking, and then laughing heartily while showing the result, indicate it was intended as a joke to amuse himself and surprise or playfully annoy his friend. The friend's confused reaction further supports the idea that it was an unexpected, lighthearted prank."
0689-1,"The man in the purple T-shirt altered the lock screen wallpaper on the other man's phone to his own picture as a prank or practical joke.

**Explanation:** The interaction appears lighthearted and playful. The man in purple quickly changes the wallpaper to a funny picture of himself, hands the phone back, and laughs heartily at the owner's confused reaction. This sequence, along with showing the result to the camera, strongly suggests the intention was to surprise and amuse his friend (and potentially viewers) for humorous effect."
0689-2,"**Yes**, the man in the purple T-shirt changed the lock screen wallpaper to his own photo to make the other man think the phone was his.

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows the man in the purple T-shirt interacting with the phone held by the other man. He taps the screen, navigates a menu, and selects a photo of himself, which then appears as the lock screen wallpaper. The subsequent confused reaction of the man in the black hoodie, contrasted with the laughter and triumphant display of the phone by the man in purple, indicates this was a prank intended to make the owner momentarily believe the phone belonged to the prankster."
0689-3,"Yes, the man in the purple T-shirt changed the lock screen wallpaper to his own photo as a prank.

**Explanation:** The video shows him deliberately taking the phone, selecting his own picture, and setting it as the wallpaper. His laughing and winking at the end, combined with the other man's surprised reaction upon seeing the changed wallpaper, clearly indicate that the action was intended as a playful joke or prank."

0690-0,"The child is lying on the ground to watch the shell game being played on the coffee table above. This position gives them a clear, unobstructed view of the actions taking place directly over them."
0690-1,"The child is lying on the floor to watch the shell game her parents are playing on the coffee table directly above her. This position gives her a clear, upward view of the game as it unfolds."
0690-2,"Yes, the child is lying on the ground to secretly take the money during the trick.

**Explanation:**
The child is positioned directly under the coffee table where the shell game is being played. During the shuffling of the bowls by the man, the money falls off the table (at 0:10) near the child. The child's presence in that specific spot allows the money to be retrieved from the floor (by the woman in this case, while the man is distracted) without the man noticing it fell, making it seem like the money disappeared from under the bowls as part of the trick."
0690-3,"The child is lying on the ground because they are **playing**.

**Explanation:** The child is actively watching the shell game the adults are playing on the coffee table directly above her. Her gaze is fixed on the game, and her position allows her a unique vantage point, suggesting engagement and participation in the activity rather than passive relaxation."
0690-7,C
0695-0,"**The woman won the game.** She was the first player to correctly arrange her four cups to match the initial sequence set by her opponent, achieving the winning score of 4 points on her final turn."
0695-1,"**The woman emerged as the winner of the competition.**

She won because she was the first player to successfully arrange her four cups (Orange, Green, Purple, Blue) in a sequence that resulted in four positional matches relative to the man's cups (Yellow, Red, Black, Blue). The off-screen judge announced a score of ""Four"" after her final turn, indicating a perfect match and victory."
0695-2,"**Yes.**

The woman won the game because, on her final turn, she arranged her cups in the sequence (Green, Orange, Purple, Blue) which the judge/voiceover confirmed as correct by stating, ""You got it!"". This indicates she successfully matched the target order required to win the ""Cup Matching 1v1"" game."
0695-3,"No, the man did not win the game. The woman won because she was the first to correctly arrange her cups to match the hidden sequence, as indicated when the announcer said, ""You got it!"" after her final turn. The game was about correctly guessing the sequence, not the speed of arranging the cups."
0695-7,A
0706-0,"The purpose of the man's actions in the first half of the video is **to record the raw footage needed for a visual effects sequence.**

**Explanation:** He sets up a camera and performs specific poses and movements on the beach. This initial recording captures his live-action performance, which serves as the base layer for adding digital effects (like the energy duplicate and ground cracking) in post-production to create the final edited scene shown in the second half."
0706-1,"The man is filming the raw footage for a video project.

**Explanation:** He sets up a camera on a tripod and then performs specific, dynamic movements and poses in front of it. These actions are clearly intended to be recorded and serve as the base layer or live-action component for a video that will later have special effects added, as demonstrated in the second part of the clip where a shadow figure and energy effects are integrated with his performance."
0706-2,"Yes, the man is shooting footage for a video with special effects.

**Explanation:** The first half of the video shows the man performing actions like lunging and posing in front of a camera set up on a tripod. The second half of the video shows the same scenes but with visual effects added, such as a shadow clone, glowing energy, and the ground cracking, demonstrating that the initial filming was the base footage for the final edited clip."
0706-3,"Yes, the man in the first half of the video is setting up a camera on a tripod to record himself. He adjusts the camera and then steps back into the frame to perform dynamic movements that resemble martial arts or action choreography."
0706-7,B
0707-0,"The purpose of the person running towards the camera is to create a dynamic transition effect. This action allows him to move quickly from a medium shot showing his dance moves to a close-up shot that prominently features the drink he is holding, making it the final focal point of the video clip."
0707-1,"The person runs towards the camera as part of a planned video sequence. After dancing further away, they move closer to transition into the next shot, which focuses on showcasing the drink they are holding before a final close-up. This movement adds energy and creates a dynamic shift in focus within the video."
0707-2,"Yes, the person walks towards the camera after performing to capture a clear close-up shot of the drink. This action is typical for filming an insert shot or B-roll footage, which is specifically intended to be edited into the final video during post-production to highlight the product or add visual detail."
0707-3,"No, the person initially runs *away* from the camera after starting the recording.

This action is part of a sequence intended as a dynamic introduction. His specific actions involve performing dance moves while holding a beverage cup, interacting with the drink (sipping, pointing, presenting it close to the camera), and using movement to engage the viewer."
0707-7,A
0708-0,"The cat screams in comedic horror and frustration upon seeing the owner arrive with a bag full of new bath products immediately after it finished destroying the previous ones in the bathtub. Its efforts to eliminate the bath supplies were futile, and the scream signifies its dramatic realization that more baths are inevitable."
0708-1,"The cat's ""yell"" in the final scene is a comedic expression of mock frustration or defiance.

**Explanation:** Throughout the video, the cat is shown disliking its bath and subsequently taking ""revenge"" by pushing numerous bath products into the tub, ruining them. However, the owner immediately thwarts the cat's efforts by revealing a large haul of replacement products purchased online (from OZON). The cat's final open-mouthed expression, likely a yawn timed for comedic effect, serves as a punchline, representing its exaggerated reaction to having its mischievous plan foiled and seeing the bath supplies fully restocked."
0708-2,"Yes, the video is edited to imply the cat screamed in reaction to seeing more bath products. The sequence shows the cat seemingly getting revenge by pushing bath products into the tub, only for the owner to immediately bring in a bag full of new ones, followed by the cat's exaggerated open-mouthed reaction, suggesting dismay."
0708-3,"No, the cat is not screaming because it is upset about the mess in the bathtub.

The video clearly shows the cat intentionally knocking various toiletries into the bathtub, thereby creating the mess itself. The final shot with the cat's mouth open is likely an edited reaction for comedic effect or a coincidental expression (like a yawn), rather than genuine distress over the mess it caused."
0708-7,C
0721-0,"**Answer:** The man is holding nothing tangible in his hand.

**Explanation:** He is using forced perspective, a photographic technique that manipulates perception of depth. By positioning his hand carefully relative to the distant airplane and the camera's viewpoint, he creates the optical illusion that he is holding the aircraft."
0721-1,"He is positioning his hands to create a forced perspective illusion with the airplane.
*   Explanation: He holds his left hand palm-up directly beneath the airplane from the camera's viewpoint, while extending his right arm, creating the visual trick that makes it seem like he is holding up or supporting the aircraft."
0721-2,"No, the man in sunglasses is not actually holding anything in his hand. This is a visual trick called forced perspective, where the man is positioned in the foreground and the airplane is much further away in the background, creating the illusion that he is holding it."
0721-3,"No, the man in sunglasses is not holding a toy airplane. He is using forced perspective photography to create an optical illusion, making it appear as though he is holding the real, full-sized airplane that is actually flying much further away in the background."
0721-7,C
0723-0,"The monster looks active because it's an optical illusion, specifically a variation of the hollow-face illusion.

**Explanation:** The monster is drawn on a concave (inward-curving) surface, like the inside of a box. Our brains are wired to see faces as convex (sticking out). When you move around the concave drawing, the way the perspective shifts tricks your brain into perceiving the static image as a convex head turning to follow you."
0723-1,"The monster seems like it's moving because of an optical illusion created by its **concave shape**.

**Explanation:** The monster's head is built inwards (concave), like the inside of a mask, rather than outwards (convex). However, our brains are strongly biased to interpret faces and similar shapes as convex. As the camera moves side-to-side, the change in perspective on the concave surface is misinterpreted by our brain as a convex object turning to follow the movement."
0723-2,"Yes, the little monster in the video appears to move due to an optical illusion involving a concave surface.

The narrator explains that the object is an ""inside-out cardboard box,"" meaning the monster's face is built inwards (concave). Our brains tend to perceive faces as convex (bulging outwards), so when viewing this concave drawing, the changing perspective as the viewer moves creates the illusion that the monster's head is turning to follow them. This is a common optical illusion known as the hollow-face illusion."
0723-3,"**No**, the monster isn't appearing to move because someone is directly manipulating it.

The apparent movement of the monster's head is an optical illusion, often referred to as the hollow-face illusion. It occurs because the monster's face is concave (built inwards, like an ""inside-out box"" as mentioned in the video). Our brains tend to perceive faces as convex (bulging outwards), and this misinterpretation, combined with the changing perspective as the camera moves, makes the concave features appear to turn and follow the viewer. The woman behind it is moving with the camera to demonstrate the effect from different angles, but she isn't physically turning the monster's head."
0723-7,D
0724-0,"The pen appears to pass through the banknote without breaking it because it's an illusion created by a specific folding technique. The pen doesn't actually pierce the paper; instead, it slides through a hidden gap or channel formed between the folded layers.

Here's how the banknote is typically folded:

1.  **Fold Lengthwise:** The banknote is first folded in half along its length (like a hotdog).
2.  **Fold Widthwise (Offset):** Next, it's folded in half widthwise (like a hamburger), but crucially, one edge is folded slightly *short* of the other edge. This creates an offset.
3.  **Fold Widthwise Again:** The note is folded widthwise once more, usually folding the section with the shorter edge over the other. This hides the gap created by the offset fold within the layers.

**Brief Explanation:** The offset fold (step 2) creates a small, hidden channel running along the inside of the folds. When the magician inserts the pen, they guide it into this channel. The pen slides horizontally *between* the layers of paper, emerging on the other side without ever actually puncturing the banknote material. When the note is unfolded, it is completely unharmed because the paper fibers were never broken."
0724-1,"The pen manages to go through the banknote without tearing it because of a specific folding method that creates a hidden channel or gap for the pen to pass through.

**How the banknote is folded:**

1.  The banknote is first folded in half lengthwise (like a hotdog).
2.  Then, it is folded in half widthwise (like a hamburger). However, during this second fold, one half of the bill is deliberately tucked *behind* the other half along the central crease line, rather than folding directly on top.

**Brief Explanation:**

This specific way of folding creates a hidden channel or slit along the widthwise fold line. The pen is inserted into this channel, not through the actual paper fibers. It slides through the gap between the folded layers and exits the other side. To the audience, it looks like the pen is piercing the bill, but in reality, it's just passing through the cleverly created space within the folds. When unfolded, the banknote is completely intact because it was never actually torn or punctured."
0724-2,"**Yes**, the reason the banknote remains intact is that the pen goes through an opening created by the specific way the banknote is folded, rather than actually piercing the material in the middle.

**Explanation:** The folding technique creates a hidden gap or channel within the layers of the banknote. The pen is carefully slid through this pre-existing opening, giving the illusion that it is penetrating the paper. When the banknote is unfolded, it is undamaged because the pen never actually broke through the paper fibers."
0724-3,"**No.** The banknote is not broken because the illusion is typically created by a specific way the banknote is folded. This folding creates a hidden gap or loop through which the pen passes, making it appear to penetrate the bill without actually tearing the paper. The pen itself is usually ordinary."

0725-0,The drink in the bottle decreased because the man poured it out into a beaker. This was done as part of a tutorial to show how to set up a trick involving a hidden balloon inside the bottle.
0725-1,"The liquid level in the bottle drops because a hidden balloon inside the bottle deflates.

**Explanation:** The video tutorial shows that a small hole is made in the bottle, a balloon is inserted through it and sealed with glue. The balloon is then inflated inside the bottle, and the Fanta is poured back in around it. The inflated balloon displaces the liquid, making the level appear higher. When the man presses the external part of the sealed balloon with the straw, the air is released, the balloon deflates, and the liquid level drops to fill the space the balloon previously occupied."
0725-2,"Yes, the drink level is decreasing because the balloon inside the bottle is deflating.

**Explanation:** The tutorial segment of the video shows that a hole was made in the bottle, and an inflated balloon was sealed inside. This inflated balloon displaces the Fanta, making the liquid level appear higher. When the man uses the straw to push on the balloon through the hole, the air is released, causing the balloon to deflate. As the balloon shrinks, it occupies less volume inside the bottle, allowing the liquid level to drop and fill the space the balloon previously occupied."
0725-3,"No, the drink level is not decreasing because it is being consumed through the straw.

**Explanation:** The video demonstrates a trick. A small hole is made in the side of the bottle (hidden by the label), and a balloon is inserted and sealed over the hole from the inside. When the man sucks on the straw placed in the bottle's opening (not in the liquid), he is actually sucking air out of the balloon through the hidden hole. This deflates the balloon, reducing its volume inside the bottle and causing the liquid level to drop, creating the illusion of drinking."
0725-7,A
0729-0,"**Red:** The video uses a blue strip to compare the lengths of the black and red strips. The comparison shown leads to the conclusion presented in the video that the black strip is longer, which means the red strip is the shorter one."
0729-1,"**Black** is the longest color strip shown in the video.

**Explanation:** The video initially presents a black strip and a red strip, posing the question of which is longer. It then overlays the red strip with a blue one and presents multiple-choice options. Finally, it compares the black strip and the blue/red strip by aligning their bottom edges, visually demonstrating that the black strip extends further on both ends, confirming it is the longest. The video reinforces this by placing a checkmark next to option A, which states ""黑色长"" (Black is long)."
0729-2,"Yes, the black strip is the longest among the strips shown in the video. The video demonstrates this by overlaying a blue strip (shown to be the same length as the red strip) onto the black strip, revealing that the black strip extends beyond the blue one on both sides."
0729-3,"No, the black strip is not the shortest. The video demonstrates an optical illusion where the black strip is perceived as being longer than the red strip."
0729-7,A
0731-0,"Based on dual perception, the old man's nose can also look like a mermaid sitting on a rock in the sea. The mermaid's body and the rock she sits on form the shape of the nose within the larger face illusion."
0731-1,The old man's nose represents a mermaid sitting on a rock. The shape of the mermaid and the rock she is perched on combine to form the structure of the nose within the larger illusion of the old man's face.
0731-2,"Yes, the old man's nose could be seen as a mermaid sitting on a reef. This is because the painting is an optical illusion where the elements of the coastal scene, including the mermaid on the rock, are arranged to form the features of the man's face, with the mermaid specifically creating the shape and position of the nose."
0731-3,"Yes, the old man's nose can be perceived as the head and beak of a bird. In the optical illusion, the bird (which appears to be a cormorant or similar seabird) is strategically placed so that its head and beak align perfectly to create the shape of the nose for the larger face formed by the landscape."
0731-7,A
0735-0,"The scenery appeared on the artboard because the artboard was actually a mirror. The mirror was positioned on the easel to perfectly reflect the sunset landscape behind it, creating the illusion that the scene was painted onto the board when the man swept his brush across it."
0735-1,"The method by which the scenery appears on the artboard is **reflection**.

**Explanation:** The ""artboard"" placed on the easel is actually a mirror. It reflects the real sunset scenery that is in front of it, creating the illusion that the scene has been painted onto the surface. The person is not actually painting the image; they are revealing the reflection."
0735-2,"Yes, the scenery on the artboard in the second segment is a reflection of the environment.

**Explanation:** The object placed on the easel is a mirror. It captures and displays the actual sunset landscape that is behind the easel, creating the visual effect shown."
0735-3,"No, the scenery on the artboard in the second segment was not painted. The artboard is actually a mirror reflecting the real sunset over the water, and the person is simulating the action of painting onto the reflection for a creative video effect."
0735-7,B
0738-0,"The man filmed the sky appearing to change from dark to bright by manually adjusting the phone camera's exposure settings while recording.

**Explanation:** He first tapped and held on the screen to lock the Auto Exposure and Auto Focus (AE/AF Lock) on the darker sunset scene. Then, while the camera was recording, he swiped upwards on the screen. This action manually increased the exposure compensation, forcing the camera to let in more light (or digitally brighten the image), making the recorded video transition from dark to bright."
0738-1,"The man used the phone's manual exposure control to make the sky appear to change from dark to light.

*   **Explanation:** He first tapped and held the screen to lock the focus and exposure (AE/AF Lock). Although the video demonstrates dragging *down* to make the image darker, to achieve the final effect (dark to light), he would have performed the opposite action: dragging his finger *upwards* on the screen during recording. This manually increases the exposure, making the initially dark scene progressively brighter."
0738-2,"No, the man did not change the sky from black to bright. He adjusted the camera's exposure settings downwards, making the initially brighter sunset scene appear much darker on the phone screen."
0738-3,"No, the man in the video did not use a time-lapse feature. He manually adjusted the camera's exposure settings on his phone; first, he lowered the exposure to make the sunset scene appear very dark (almost black), and then he increased the exposure back to normal, making it look like the scene rapidly brightened. This is a real-time exposure control technique, not a time-lapse which captures changes over a longer period and speeds them up."

0740-2,"Yes, the third step shown in the video for the first math problem, 8 ÷ 2(2 + 2), is performing the multiplication of 4 × 4.

**Explanation:**
1.  **First step (Parentheses):** The expression inside the parentheses is calculated: (2 + 2) = 4. The problem becomes 8 ÷ 2(4).
2.  **Second step (Division):** Following PEMDAS/BODMAS and working from left to right for operations with equal precedence (Multiplication/Division), the division is performed: 8 ÷ 2 = 4. The problem becomes 4(4).

0740-3,"Yes, the third step shown in the video for the first math problem (8 ÷ 2(2 + 2)) is performing the division of 8 ÷ 2.

**Explanation:**
1.  The first step shown is solving the parentheses: (2 + 2) = 4.
2.  The expression becomes 8 ÷ 2(4).
3.  Following the PEMDAS/BODMAS order of operations, multiplication and division have equal precedence and are performed from left to right. Therefore, the next operation (the third step in the calculation sequence) is the division 8 ÷ 2, which equals 4."

0742-0,"The value of x is 18.

**Explanation:**
The diagram shows a straight line with a right angle (90°) marked. The angles adjacent to the right angle (x°, 2x°, and 2x°) must also sum to 90° because angles on a straight line add up to 180°. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
x + 2x + 2x = 90
Combining the terms gives:
5x = 90
Dividing both sides by 5 gives:
x = 18"
0742-1,"To determine the value of x, recognize that the angles x°, 2x°, and 2x° are adjacent to a marked 90° angle on a straight line. Angles on a straight line sum to 180°. Therefore, the sum of x, 2x, and 2x must be equal to 180° - 90° = 90°. Set up the equation x + 2x + 2x = 90, combine like terms to get 5x = 90, and then solve for x by dividing 90 by 5."
0742-2,"Yes, the value of x is 18. The diagram shows angles x, 2x, and 2x adjacent to a right angle (90°) on a straight line. These angles must also sum to 90°. Therefore, x + 2x + 2x = 90°, which simplifies to 5x = 90°. Dividing both sides by 5 gives x = 18."
0742-3,"No, the value of x is not 25. The diagram shows angles x°, 2x°, and 2x° adjacent to a 90° angle on a straight line. These three angles must also sum to 90°. Therefore, x + 2x + 2x = 90, which simplifies to 5x = 90. Solving for x gives x = 18."

0749-0,"The substances that can pass through the sieve are the yellow liquid, smaller rice grains, and finer particles of the white powder.

**Explanation:** The sieve separates materials based on size. The liquid flows through the mesh openings easily. Solid particles, like the rice grains and the white powder, can only pass through if their individual size is smaller than the holes in the sieve's mesh. Larger grains and particles are retained by the sieve."
0749-1,"The materials able to pass through the sieve are the rice grains, the yellow liquid, and the flour.

This occurs because the individual rice grains and flour particles are smaller than the openings in the sieve's mesh, allowing them to fall through. The yellow liquid, being a fluid, can easily flow through these same openings."
0749-2,"No, only the rice passes through the sieve. The yellow substance (referred to as coarse grain) does not pass through. This is because the sieve's mesh holes are sized to allow the smaller rice grains to fall through while retaining the yellow substance, which either has larger components or behaves differently (like a liquid/suspension) and doesn't easily pass through the mesh."
0749-3,"**No**, the flour does not pass through the sieve.

**Explanation:** Before scooping the flour, the sieve is dipped into a liquid (yellow substance, likely egg wash). This liquid coating on the sieve wires causes the fine flour particles to adhere to the mesh due to surface tension and adhesion, effectively blocking the holes and preventing the flour from falling through."

0755-0,"The sponge is made of **cake**.

**Explanation:** The video follows the ""everything is cake"" trend. Although the woman initially pretends to use the sponge for cleaning, she then puts it in her mouth. Subsequent clips in the video show other objects being cut open to reveal they are cakes, confirming that the sponge is also an edible cake designed to look like a real sponge."
0755-1,"The composition of the sponge shown in the video is **cake**.

**Explanation:** The video shows a woman initially using the object as if it were a real sponge, but then she proceeds to take a bite out of it, revealing it to be an edible item. This, along with other objects in the video being revealed as cakes, indicates the sponge is a hyperrealistic cake designed to look like a cleaning sponge."
0755-2,"Yes, the sponge in the video is made of an edible material like cake. The video shows the woman biting into the sponge, and later reveals other seemingly non-edible items (like a soap bottle and a bowl of noodles) are actually hyperrealistic cakes when cut open, indicating the sponge is also part of this illusion."
0755-3,"**No**, the sponge in the video is not made of synthetic materials like polyurethane foam. The woman in the video bites into the sponge, revealing that it is actually an edible item, likely a hyperrealistic cake designed to look like a sponge."

0762-0,"The second boat was made of paper/cardboard sheets.

**Explanation:** The emoji shown above this attempt is a stack of paper (📄). Visually, the boat is constructed from large, white, flat sheets folded into shape. It sinks almost instantly when the man steps onto it, consistent with how paper or cardboard would behave when saturated with water."
0762-1,"The second boat was made of **paper**. This is shown by the paper emoji (📄) displayed above the object in the video, and the object itself resembles a large stack of paper which quickly sinks when the man steps on it."
0762-2,"Yes, the second boat is implied to be made of paper. This is indicated by the paper emoji (📄) highlighted during that attempt in the video, and its immediate sinking when stepped on is consistent with the properties of paper losing structural integrity in water under weight."
0762-3,"No, the second boat is not made of a mattress. The highlighted emoji (🗒️) represents sheets of paper or a notepad, not a mattress. Visually, the boat appears to be a simple, white, hollow structure, not a mattress, and it sinks almost immediately."

0763-0,"The canned Coke that was taken away is the real one.

**Explanation:** The hand physically interacts with this can by placing it down and then picking it up and removing it from the scene. This interaction demonstrates that it is a tangible, three-dimensional object, unlike the stationary can which remains untouched and could be part of an optical illusion drawing."
0763-1,"**The one removed** is the genuine canned Coke.

**Explanation:** The video shows a hand physically placing the first can, and later picking it up and removing it. This physical interaction demonstrates that it is a real, three-dimensional object. The second can appears instantly next to the first without being placed by the hand, which is characteristic of the visual illusions being demonstrated throughout the video."
0763-2,"Yes, the canned Coke that was moved aside was a real canned Coke. The illusion works because there were two identical real cans positioned so that one completely hid the other from the camera's viewpoint until the front one was shifted."
0763-3,"Yes, the real canned Coke is the one that is still in the picture.

The video demonstrates an optical illusion where the rapid movement of the single, real can briefly creates the visual impression of a second can appearing alongside it. The can that remains visible after the illusion is performed is the actual, physical object used for the demonstration."

0766-0,"**Answer:** The archer used her right shoulder to release the bow.
*   **Explanation:** The video shows the archer drawing the bowstring back using a release aid held in her mouth. She anchors this release aid near her right jaw and shoulder area before releasing the arrow. Therefore, the release action originates from the right shoulder side."
0766-1,"**Right Shoulder Area:**

The archer, Sheetal Devi, uses a unique technique due to phocomelia, holding the bow with her feet and drawing the string using a release aid operated by her mouth/jaw, attached to a shoulder harness. She draws the string back towards the **right side** of her face, anchoring near her right jaw/cheek. Therefore, the release originates from the **right side** of her upper body, anatomically closest to the right shoulder area, although not involving the shoulder muscles in the conventional manner."
0766-2,"No, the archer did not release the bow using their right shoulder.
**Explanation:** The video shows the archer using her feet to stabilize and hold the bow. She draws the bowstring back using a release aid mechanism that appears to be operated by her mouth/chin area, which triggers the release of the arrow. Her shoulder is involved in the posture and drawing tension, but it is not the body part directly initiating the release of the string."
0766-3,"**No**, the archer did not release the bow using her left shoulder.

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows the archer using a pink mouth tab to hold the bowstring at full draw. The release occurs when she opens her mouth, letting go of the tab and the string. Her left shoulder is part of her posture and stability while seated but is not involved in the actual release mechanism. She uses her right foot to hold the bow and her right arm/hand to draw the string."

0779-0,"**Illusion:** The video demonstrates the Penrose Triangle, also known as the impossible triangle.

**How it's Achieved:** The illusion is created using **forced perspective**. The orange object is not actually a solid, three-dimensional triangle made of connected cubes as it initially appears. Instead, it's a cleverly designed physical object, likely with gaps or disconnected parts. When viewed from one very specific angle (as shown at the start), these separate parts visually align perfectly, tricking the eye and brain into perceiving a continuous, geometrically impossible structure. Rotating the object reveals its true, non-impossible shape and breaks the illusion by showing the gaps and how the parts are actually arranged."
0779-1,"**Illusion:** The illusion shown is the **Penrose Triangle** (also known as the Penrose Tribar or impossible triangle).

**Creation:** The illusion is created using a physical **3D object** that is cleverly designed to exploit **forced perspective**. From the specific initial viewing angle, the separate parts and angled sections of the object align perfectly to mimic the appearance of the geometrically impossible Penrose Triangle, which seems like a continuous loop made of three straight bars meeting at right angles. When the object is rotated, the perspective changes, revealing its true, non-continuous, and physically possible structure, breaking the illusion."
0779-2,"Yes, the video shows a Penrose Triangle illusion created by arranging concave structures to appear as floating cubes.

The video initially presents the object from an angle where it looks like nine distinct orange cubes forming an impossible triangle (Penrose Triangle). However, when the object is rotated, its true form is revealed: a single piece with specifically shaped concave sections and ridges that only create the illusion of cubes from that specific viewpoint."
0779-3,"Yes, the illusion is achieved by aligning blocks to form a continuous triangle from a specific angle.

**Explanation:** The video initially shows the object from a perspective where separate orange block segments visually connect to form the impossible Penrose triangle shape. When the object is rotated, its actual disconnected structure is revealed, showing that the illusion relies entirely on this specific viewpoint and the precise alignment of the pieces."

0790-0,"Rotate the transparent sheet so it is held vertically.

**Explanation:** The video shows that when the sheet is initially held horizontally, the vertical blue tube disappears behind it. When the sheet is rotated 90 degrees to a vertical orientation (parallel to the blue tube), the blue tube becomes visible through the sheet."
0790-1,"To make the blue tube visible through the transparent sheet, the sheet needs to be rotated 90 degrees from its initial horizontal position to a vertical orientation.

**Explanation:** When the sheet is held horizontally, it obscures the vertical blue tube while allowing the horizontal red and green tubes to be seen. Rotating the sheet 90 degrees so it is held vertically makes the blue tube visible through it, while the horizontal red and green tubes become obscured. This suggests the sheet acts like a polarizing filter, selectively allowing light or images aligned with its orientation to pass through while blocking those perpendicular to it."
0790-2,"Yes, the transparent sheet should be rotated by 90 degrees (vertically) to see the blue tube.

**Explanation:**
When the sheet is held horizontally, it makes the vertically oriented blue tube disappear where it overlaps. However, when the sheet is rotated 90 degrees to a vertical orientation, the vertical blue tube becomes fully visible through the sheet, while the horizontal red and green tubes behind it disappear. This is due to the polarizing properties of the sheet."
0790-3,"No, rotating the transparent sheet by 45 degrees does not allow the blue tube to be seen clearly.

**Explanation:** According to the video, rotating the sheet by 45 degrees makes all the tubes behind it appear blurry or disappear. To see the blue tube clearly through the sheet, the sheet must be oriented vertically (rotated 90 degrees from its initial horizontal position). In this vertical orientation, the horizontal red and green tubes become invisible behind the sheet."

0794-0,"The ""friend"" referred to in the caption is the second cat shown in the video (the white one with black spots).

**Explanation:** The caption ""POV: Never trust your friend 💀"" appears just before this second cat looks over the edge and then jumps down. The jump is presented as the untrustworthy or unexpected action performed by the ""friend""."
0794-1,"The 'friend' described in the caption is the **second cat (white with black spots)** that appears on the ledge.

**Explanation:** The caption ""POV: Never trust your friend 💀"" implies an act of betrayal. In the video, the second cat pushes the first cat off the ledge. This action is the betrayal the caption refers to, identifying the pusher cat as the untrustworthy 'friend'."
0794-2,"Yes, the white cat that leaves quickly at the start of the video is implied to be the 'friend' in the caption.

**Explanation:** The video shows the white cat on the ledge first, then it leaves. Immediately after, a second cat appears and jumps down towards waiting dogs. The caption ""POV: Never trust your friend"" suggests the second cat (whose perspective we are arguably taking) was led to or left in this precarious situation by the first cat (the 'friend') who then abandoned it before the risky jump."
0794-3,"Yes, the 'friend' in the caption is likely the black dog.

*   **Explanation:** The caption ""POV: Never trust your friend"" is shown from the cat's perspective before it jumps. Immediately after the cat lands, the black dog rushes towards it. This sequence implies that the black dog's action is the untrustworthy behavior the caption is warning about from the cat's point of view."

**Explanation:** The presenter in the video explicitly refers to the burning items as ""these candles"" before placing the glass vase over them. The object appears to be multiple small, thin candles bundled together and lit simultaneously."
0803-2,True. The video clearly shows a cluster of small candles with lit wicks producing a visible flame at the start of the experiment.
0803-3,"**No**, the burning object is not a single blue sponge-like object. It appears to be a cluster of many small candles or wicks held together in a small, blue base.

0812-1,"The person made three attempts to put the toy into the drawer. The video shows the person pushing the toy towards the drawer space three separate times; the first two times, the toy bounced back out, and on the third push, it appeared to go in just before the clip ended."
0812-2,"No, the person tried to place the toy under the desk four times, not exactly three.

*   **Explanation:** Observing the video between 0:08 and 0:13, the person makes four separate attempts to push the toy into the space under the desk where the backpack is located, exceeding the number specified in the question."

0816-0,"In the second experiment, the person swirled the inverted bottle.

This action created a vortex (or whirlpool) inside the bottle. The vortex formed a stable air channel through the center of the water, allowing air to enter the bottle continuously while the water flowed out smoothly around it, significantly speeding up the draining process compared to the first attempt where air and water had to compete for the opening."
0816-1,"During the second experiment, the person **swirled the bottle** vigorously before **inverting it** over the container.

**Explanation:** This swirling action created a **vortex (or whirlpool)** within the water. When the bottle was inverted, this vortex formed a stable, open channel through the center of the water, allowing air to flow easily into the bottle while the water flowed out smoothly and rapidly around it. This simultaneous exchange of air and water prevented the ""glugging"" effect seen in the first experiment and significantly reduced the emptying time."
0816-2,"Yes, the person spun the bottle to create a vortex in the second experiment.

**Explanation:** In the second attempt (starting around 0:09), the person swirls the bottle in a circular motion before turning it upside down. This creates a vortex (a whirlpool) in the water. The vortex forms an air channel through the center, allowing air to enter the bottle easily while the water flows out around it, making the bottle empty much faster than in the first attempt where no spinning occurred."
0816-3,"No, the person did not insert a straw into the bottle during the second experiment.

In the second experiment shown (approximately 0:09-0:15), the person swirled the water to create a vortex before inverting the bottle. This vortex allowed air to enter while the water exited, speeding up the draining process compared to the first experiment. The straw was only inserted for the third experiment (starting around 0:15) to demonstrate an even faster draining method by providing a direct air channel."

0833-0,"The photo in the fourth segment (0:18 - 0:24) aims to show the illusion of **levitation or an out-of-body experience**.

**Explanation:** By combining two shots (one of the man lying on the sand and another of him balanced horizontally on a stool, which is then edited out), the final image creates a surreal effect where the man appears to be floating weightlessly above his own physical body under the pier. The semi-transparent nature of the floating figure enhances this ethereal, ghost-like, or spiritual interpretation."
0833-1,"The fourth segment depicts a man appearing to have an out-of-body experience under a pier.
**Explanation:** The video shows the setup where the man is first lying on the sand, and then positioned horizontally on a stool with assistance. The final edited photograph shows the man lying on the sand while a semi-transparent version of him floats above, creating a levitation or astral projection effect after the stool and assistant are digitally removed."
0833-2,"No, the fourth segment does not show an actual soul flying above the man. It demonstrates a photography trick. The video shows the setup where the man is physically supported on a stool to appear horizontal in the air, and this shot is then edited and composited over a shot of him lying on the sand to create the *illusion* of his spirit or soul floating above his body."

0848-0,"The top figure is the real cat. It exhibits independent, lifelike movement consistent with a walking cat and appears more three-dimensional, while the bottom figure is flat, slightly distorted, and moves in perfect synchrony below it, characteristic of a shadow."
0848-1,"**Top Cat:** The top silhouette is the actual cat because it is the physical object casting the shadow, which is the silhouette seen directly beneath it on the surface."
0848-2,"Yes, the real cat is the one at the top of the frame. The top figure shows independent, three-dimensional movement characteristic of a physical animal, while the bottom figure is a flat, two-dimensional projection onto the surface below, behaving exactly as a shadow would."
0848-3,"**Yes**, the top figure is the real cat, and the bottom figure is its shadow. The top figure moves with the characteristics of a physical animal, while the bottom figure mimics its shape and movement on the surface below, consistent with how shadows are cast by an object blocking a light source."

0854-0,"The operator engages in conversation with the visitors primarily to distract them and catch them off guard.

*Explanation:* By chatting casually, the operator prevents the riders from anticipating the exact moment the drop will occur. This element of surprise, dropping them when they are psychologically unprepared, significantly enhances the shock and thrill of the ride experience. The video text explicitly mentions he chats with them and then suddenly activates the ride so they drop without mental readiness."
0854-1,"The operator talks to the visitors primarily to distract them and catch them off guard.

**Explanation:** By engaging in casual conversation, and sometimes even pretending there's a malfunction with the ride, the operator ensures the riders are not mentally prepared for the exact moment of the drop. This element of surprise heightens the thrill, intensifies the reaction, and makes the experience more memorable, as the drop occurs unexpectedly when their guard is down."
0854-2,"Yes, the operator talks to visitors to make them more nervous and scared.

**Explanation:** The video's text overlay states that the operator often chats casually with riders before suddenly starting the ride, catching them off guard. It also mentions that he sometimes pretends the machine is malfunctioning, which increases the riders' fear and nervousness before the drop."
0854-3,"**No, the operator's conversation is not meant to help visitors feel more at ease and prepared.**

**Explanation:** The video shows the operator engaging in casual conversation or even pretending there's an issue with the ride specifically to distract the riders. He then suddenly activates the drop when they are least expecting it, maximizing the element of surprise and thrill, rather than easing their nerves or preparing them for the fall. The text overlay confirms this by stating riders are dropped ""in a situation where they have no psychological preparation."""

0857-0,"The woman is imitating a Barbie doll falling over.

**Explanation:** Her movements, particularly the stiff way she falls backward and forward without trying to brace herself, mimic how a rigid plastic doll with limited articulation and balance would topple over. This interpretation is strongly supported by the accompanying music, Aqua's ""Barbie Girl,"" which explicitly references being a plastic doll."
0857-1,"The woman is depicting how a stiff, plastic doll, like Barbie, would fall over.

**Explanation:** Her movements are intentionally rigid and lack the natural reflexes a human would use to brace themselves or break a fall (e.g., putting out hands). She simply tips over backward and forward, mimicking the way an inanimate toy figure would collapse, directly referencing the ""Barbie Girl"" song playing and its ""life in plastic"" theme."
0857-2,"The video features a woman, not a man.

No, the woman in the video is not imitating the experience of being shot. She is playfully and intentionally falling backward and sliding forward on a sand dune, interacting with the environment in a recreational manner. Her movements do not resemble the sudden impact or reaction associated with being shot."
0857-3,"Yes, the woman in the video is imitating the act of fainting.

**Explanation:**
The woman deliberately throws herself backward onto the soft sand dune in a dramatic fashion. Her movements appear controlled and intentional, rather than the sudden, involuntary loss of posture associated with genuine fainting. The playful context and her subsequent actions further suggest she is performing the fall for effect or fun."
0857-7,D
0858-0,"The man initially sat on the structure that appears to be the left armrest.

**Explanation:** When the man approaches the chair and sits down (around 0:25-0:28), he lowers himself onto the part of the structure located on the viewer's left, which visually resembles the left armrest of the chair, even though the narration later reveals this is part of an optical illusion."
0858-1,"The man in the white short-sleeved shirt first tried to sit on what appeared to be the **left armrest**.

**Explanation:** Due to the optical illusion created by the chair's design and the camera angle, the man's initial movement and positioning make it look like he is aiming to sit on the structure that appears as the left armrest from that viewpoint."
0858-2,"Yes, the man initially sat on the right armrest of the chair. Although visually it appears he is sitting on the left armrest from the initial camera angle, the video explains that this is an optical illusion, and the part he actually sat on corresponds to the right armrest of a conventionally oriented chair."
0858-3,"No, the man in the white short-sleeved shirt did not initially sit on the left armrest of the chair. The video explains that this is an optical illusion; while it appears he is sitting on the left armrest from the initial perspective, he actually sits on what is functionally the right armrest or the intended seat of the specially designed chair."
0858-7,C
0865-0,"At the end of the video, there are **two** worm-like creatures visible on the ground.

**Explanation:** The video shows a brown worm that the bird is interacting with, and a smaller green creature (likely a caterpillar or larva) nearby. Neither creature is eaten by the bird, and both remain on the ground when the video ends."
0865-1,"One worm can be seen at the conclusion of the video. It is lying on the ground near the baby bird, uneaten."
0865-2,"**No**, at the end of the video, two worm-like creatures are visible on the ground. One is a brownish worm near the bird by the crack, and the other is a smaller green worm/caterpillar further away on the concrete surface."
0865-3,"No. At the end of the video, there is only one worm visible on the ground, and the bird's beak is empty."
0865-7,B
0868-0,The tool swung at the beginning of the video is primarily red. It is a screwdriver with a distinct red handle and a metallic shaft.
0868-1,"The color of the tool used by the person at the start of the video is primarily red. This is because the tool, which appears to be a screwdriver, has a distinct red handle, while the shaft is metallic."
0868-2,"No, the tool used at the very beginning of the video (0:00-0:01) is a screwdriver with a red handle and silver shaft, and it is being pushed, not swung. A hammer with a silver head and wooden handle is swung later in the video (around 0:03)."
0868-3,"Yes, the tool that the person uses at the beginning of the video is red. Specifically, the handle of the screwdriver being used is red."
0868-7,B
0870-0,"Based on the video, the premise of the question is incorrect. The man did **not** give his belongings to the photographer.

Instead, the video shows the photographer providing help to the man and the child. The photographer gives them food (bread, snacks, drinks), money, and an umbrella to shelter them from the rain. The man and child are recipients of charity in this interaction, not givers."
0870-1,"The premise of the question is incorrect based on the video.

**Explanation:** The video does not show the man handing over his belongings to the photographer. Instead, it depicts the photographer giving items such as food, drinks, an umbrella, and money to the man and the child, who appear to be poor and in need of assistance. The man accepts these items gratefully."
0870-2,"**No**, the man did not give his belongings to the photographer.

**Explanation:** The video shows the opposite happening. The photographer provides the man and child with food (bread), money, snacks, drinks, and an umbrella for shelter from the rain. The man is depicted as someone in need receiving help, not as someone giving away possessions out of kindness."
0870-3,"No, the man did not give his belongings to the photographer in exchange for food and other necessities.

The video shows the photographer providing charitable aid to the man and child, including food, snacks, drinks, money, and an umbrella, without receiving any of the man's possessions in return. The interaction depicts an act of kindness and assistance, not a transaction or exchange."
0870-7,C
0871-0,"A person is in the middle of the road. Initially, the person is bending down towards a pink object, and then a visual effect stretches their form vertically."
0871-1,"Located in the center of the road is a person whose appearance is distorted by a visual effect. Their body is stretched vertically, making them look unnaturally tall and thin, which indicates a filter or digital manipulation has been applied to the video. The person is also holding a pink, disc-shaped object."
0871-2,"No, there is not a chalk drawing of a young boy picking up a pink ball in the middle of the road. The figure seen in the video appears to be a digital effect or video manipulation, as it unnaturally stretches vertically and then disappears, which is not characteristic of a physical chalk drawing."
0871-3,"No, there is a person in the middle of the road, but they are holding only one pink object, not two bags."
0871-7,D
0872-0,"**Left.**

After placing both packs of water bottles on the ground near the seated man (around 0:42-0:43), the standing man uses his hand to slide the upper pack slightly towards the left side of the screen from the camera's perspective, adjusting its position relative to the lower pack."
0872-1,"From the camera's viewpoint, the man moved the top water bottle pack slightly to the **left** after placing both packs down. He initially set down two packs stacked vertically, and then slid the top one a bit to his left (which corresponds to the left side of the frame from the camera's angle)."
0872-2,"Yes, the man moved the upper water bottle pack slightly to the left from the camera's perspective after placing it down. He initially sets the top pack down, then slides it a bit to his right (which appears as left from the camera's viewpoint) to adjust its position on top of the lower pack."
0872-3,"No, the man did not move the upper water bottle pack to the right after placing them down. He placed the two stacked packs of water bottles on the ground and then immediately stood up and walked away without adjusting their position."
0872-7,D
0875-0,"There is one cell phone on the piano. It is located on the left side, near the lower keys, and has a circular magnetic attachment on the back."
0875-1,"There is one cell phone placed on the piano in the video. It is a black smartphone positioned horizontally on the left side, above the keys."
0875-2,"Yes, there are two cell phones visible on the piano. One phone on the left side has a light-colored case, and another phone on the right side has a green case."
0875-3,"Yes, there is only one cell phone visible on the piano, positioned to the left of the pianist's hands. This phone is consistently seen in that location throughout the video while the pianist plays."
0875-7,D
0879-0,"**They are not standing on the same plane.**

**Explanation:** After the fourth second, the camera angle shifts, revealing that the object is an optical illusion (a Penrose triangle constructed from separate parts). This change in perspective clearly shows that the Lego figures are positioned on different, disconnected surfaces, not on a single, continuous plane as the initial view suggested."
0879-1,"Starting from the fourth second, the camera movement reveals the optical illusion. It becomes clear that the three Lego figures are **not** on the same plane. Each figure is positioned on a separate, disconnected piece of the white structure.

Therefore, based on the visual evidence from the fourth second onwards, there are no figures sharing the same plane, and the question's premise does not apply to the situation shown."
0879-2,"No, the two figures are not standing on the same physical plane. The object they are on is a Penrose triangle, which is an optical illusion. The surfaces only appear connected and continuous from this specific viewpoint; physically, the parts where the figures stand are separate and not coplanar."
0879-3,"No, the figures are not on the same physical plane. The object they are standing on is a Penrose triangle, which is an optical illusion. It is designed to look like a single continuous object or plane from a specific viewpoint, but in reality, the parts where the figures are placed cannot physically connect in that way to form a single plane."
0879-7,D
0880-0,"When the person holds up the mirror with their hand, it doesn't change the direction of the physical arrow structure. Instead, this action allows for the observation of the arrow's reflection. It reveals that the reflection points in the same direction as the actual arrow (left, after the base rotation), which is contrary to the typical left-right reversal seen in a plane mirror."
0880-1,"When the structure is lifted by hand and rotated 180 degrees, its perceived direction remains pointing to the right.

This occurs because the object is an ambiguous 3D shape designed to create an optical illusion. Regardless of the 180-degree physical rotation, the specific curves and angles presented to the viewer are consistently interpreted by the brain as an arrow pointing to the right."
0880-2,"Yes, the structure loses its directional illusion when held up towards the camera.

The illusion that the arrow always points in one direction (to the right in the video) is dependent on the viewing angle. When the structure is held up and rotated freely, its actual complex 3D shape is revealed from different perspectives, and it no longer consistently appears as an arrow pointing in a single direction."
0880-3,"**No**, the structure does not appear to change direction due to its interaction with a mirror. The change in direction occurs because a hand physically lifts the structure and rotates it 180 degrees before placing it back down. The mirror simply reflects the actual orientation of the structure after it has been manually turned."

0886-0,The watch is worn on the man's left wrist. This is visible when he raises his arms at the beginning of the video and also when he handles the glass tube.
0886-1,"The man in black is wearing his watch on his **left** wrist. This is clearly visible throughout the video, especially when he initially raises both hands holding the cans and later when he lifts and inverts the tube."
0886-2,"No, the watch is not worn on the man's right wrist. The video clearly shows the watch is on his left wrist."
0886-3,"Yes, the watch is worn on the left wrist of the man in black. Throughout the video, especially when he raises his arms to drop the cans or manipulate the tube, a watch is clearly visible on his left wrist."
0886-7,C
0895-0,"The scene cut to after the smaller basketball is thrown into the mini hoop is the ""chainsaw rim"" scene.

**Explanation:** The video shows a successful shot into a ""mini hoop"" using a smaller basketball (0:04-0:07). Immediately following this, at 0:08, the video transitions to a scene explicitly labeled ""chainsaw rim,"" which features a different hoop modified with a chainsaw chain around its rim in an outdoor, wooded setting."
0895-1,"The scene cuts to a different trick shot attempt labeled ""chainsaw rim"". In this scene, a man successfully shoots a basketball through a hoop that has been modified with a rotating chainsaw chain around the rim."
0895-2,"Yes, the scene cuts to a person shooting a basketball into a chainsaw-rim hoop after the mini hoop shot. The video shows the successful shot into the mini hoop concluding around the 7-second mark, and immediately transitions to the scene featuring the chainsaw rim hoop beginning at the 7-second mark."
0895-3,"**No, the scene does not cut to a person shooting into a mini hoop after a smaller basketball is thrown.**

*   Explanation: The video cuts to the mini hoop scene (0:03) immediately after the spiked hoop scene (0:00-0:03). The basketball used in the preceding spiked hoop scene appears to be a standard size, not a smaller one. Furthermore, the basketball used in the mini hoop scene itself also looks like a standard-sized ball, which emphasizes the small size of the hoop."
0895-7,B
0898-0,"The man moved the first pillow **towards himself/the couch**.

**Explanation:** After throwing the first pillow onto the digitally rendered water and stepping onto a second pillow, the man reaches forward and pulls the first pillow back towards his position near the couch."
0898-1,"The man moved the first pillow towards the center of the whirlpool effect.

After placing the pillow onto the floor graphic depicting swirling water, he gave it a push, directing it towards the central, deepest-looking part of the vortex illusion."
0898-2,"No, the man did not move the first pillow closer to the camera after it was on the water. He threw the first pillow onto the digitally created water effect, where it landed. He then used a second pillow to step from the couch onto the first pillow, but he did not reposition the first pillow after it had landed."
0898-3,"No, the man did not move the first pillow to the right after it was on the water. After throwing the first pillow, he threw a second one and then stepped onto the second pillow before stepping onto the first pillow; he did not perform a separate action to push or reposition the first pillow to the right."
0898-7,D
0901-0,"At the beginning of the video, there is **one** rubber band held in the hands. It is stretched between the thumb and index finger of the left hand and the thumb and index finger of the right hand."
0901-1,There is one rubber band being held at the start of the video. It is a single green rubber band stretched between the thumb and index finger of both hands.
0901-2,"No, the hand is holding only one rubber band at the beginning of the video. The single rubber band is stretched between the index finger and thumb of both hands."
0901-3,"Yes, the hand is holding only one rubber band at the beginning of the video. The video starts by showing a single green rubber band stretched between the fingers of both hands before any manipulation occurs."
0901-7,C
0905-0,"**Downhill:** Although the camera angle at the beginning makes it appear as if the marble is on an uphill slope, this is an optical illusion. The video later reveals that the object consists of four ramps that all physically slope downwards towards the center. The marble rolls towards the center because it is following gravity down the actual slope."
0905-1,"**Decline:** The ball is positioned on a decline. Although the camera angle at the start creates an optical illusion making the ramp appear to slope upwards towards the center, the video later reveals that all ramps physically slope downwards towards the center, which is why the ball rolls inwards when released."
0905-2,"Yes, the slope is downhill.

Although the initial camera angle creates an optical illusion making it appear the marble rolls uphill, the video later reveals that the ramp is physically constructed to slope downwards towards the center of the object, allowing gravity to pull the marble in that direction."
0905-3,"No, the slope is not an uphill slope.

It is actually a downhill slope. The video reveals that the object is a 3D-printed optical illusion where, from the specific initial camera angle, the downward slope appears to be an upward slope. When the object is rotated, its true construction as four ramps sloping downwards towards the center becomes clear."
0905-7,B
0907-0,"The dog lands on the **grass**.

**Explanation:** After the man jumps on one end of the wooden plank acting as a seesaw, the dog is launched into the air from the other end and lands directly onto the grassy lawn in the backyard."
0907-1,"The dog lands on the grass in the backyard.

Explanation: After the man jumps on the makeshift seesaw, the dog is launched into the air and lands a short distance away on the grassy lawn area visible in the video."
0907-2,"**No**, the dog does not land on the man's body. At the end of the video, after the man jumps on the plank launching the dog, both the man and the dog fall onto the grass, landing separately next to each other."
0907-3,"Yes, the dog lands on the grass at the end of the video. After the man jumps on the makeshift seesaw, the dog is launched into the air and lands directly onto the grassy lawn, rolling slightly upon impact."
0907-7,B
0910-0,"The man appears to be repeatedly picking up the child as part of a playful interaction, likely for the benefit of someone filming them. He carries the child a short distance towards a doorway, puts him down, and then repeats the action several times. This repetition, along with the man pointing towards the camera near the end, suggests it's a staged or fun activity for a video, possibly intended to create a looping effect."
0910-1,"The man is repeatedly picking up the child as part of filming a video or skit.

**Explanation:** The action is performed consistently and repetitively in a public space as various pedestrians pass by. The man occasionally interacts with onlookers (like pointing at someone), suggesting the scene is staged for observation or recording, likely for online content, a social experiment, or a comedic skit where the repetition is a key element."
0910-2,"Yes, it is highly likely the man is picking up the child as part of a social experiment.

**Explanation:** The man repeatedly picks up the child in the same manner in a public place while numerous people walk by without intervening. The child does not appear genuinely distressed, and the repetitive nature of the action strongly suggests a staged scenario designed to observe bystander reactions, which is characteristic of a social experiment."
0910-3,"No, the man is not picking up the child to help them cross the street safely.

**Explanation:** The video shows the man repeatedly picking up the child and carrying him along the sidewalk, parallel to the street, towards and into a doorway. He does not move towards the street or attempt to cross it while carrying the child."
0910-7,D
0914-0,"The beer bottle is placed under the faucet to apply hot water to the black sleeve covering it.

**Explanation:** The black sleeve is made of a heat-shrink material. The hot water from the faucet provides the necessary heat to cause the sleeve to shrink and conform tightly to the shape of the bottle, effectively applying it as a label or decorative wrap."
0914-1,"The purpose of placing the beer bottle under the faucet is to apply a shrink sleeve label.

**Explanation:** The video shows a loose sleeve being placed over the bottle. When the water from the faucet runs over it, the sleeve material shrinks rapidly and conforms tightly to the shape of the bottle, effectively applying a branded or decorative covering. The water acts as the trigger for this shrinking process."
0914-2,"Yes, the beer bottle is placed under the faucet to show how hot water can shrink plastic packaging around it.

**Explanation:** The video shows a bottle covered with a loose plastic sleeve being placed under a faucet explicitly marked ""Hot Water"". When the hot water runs over the bottle, the plastic sleeve visibly contracts and tightens, conforming to the shape of the bottle, demonstrating the heat-shrinking properties of the plastic packaging."
0914-3,"**No**, the beer bottle is not placed under the faucet to demonstrate a quick cooling method.

**Explanation:** The faucet is clearly labeled ""Hot Water"" (热开水). Running hot water over the bottle would warm it, not cool it. The video actually demonstrates a feature of the bottle's packaging where the outer layer changes or reveals the label underneath when exposed to hot water."
0914-7,A
0918-0,The man uses his right hand to put the soap shavings into the box. He holds the box steady with his left hand and uses his right hand to pick up the shavings and place them inside.
0918-1,"The man places the soap into the box using his **right hand**.

**Explanation:** In the video, the man holds the small clear container (box/jar) steady with his left hand while using his right hand to pick up the individual soap shavings and deposit them into the container."
0918-2,"Yes, the man uses his right hand to put the soap shavings into the container. After placing the first shaving with his left hand, he uses his right hand to pick up and add the remaining shavings to the small jar."
0918-3,"No, the man does not use his left hand to put the soap in the box. He holds the container with his left hand and uses his right hand to pick up the soap shavings and place them inside the container."
0918-7,D
0919-0,"The man creates the rainbow by first coloring parallel stripes of different colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple) onto a piece of clear adhesive tape using markers. He then shines the flashlight from his smartphone through this colored section of tape. The marker ink acts as a color filter, allowing specific colors of light to pass through and project onto a surface, creating the rainbow pattern."
0919-1,"The man creates a rainbow effect by first coloring stripes onto a piece of clear adhesive tape using different colored markers (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple). He then places this colored tape over his phone's flashlight. When the flashlight is turned on in a darkened room and aimed at a surface, the light shines through the colored sections of the tape, projecting the colors onto the surface in a rainbow pattern. The colored tape acts as a simple filter for the phone's light."
0919-2,"**Yes**, the man creates the rainbow effect by coloring stripes onto a roll of clear tape using different colored markers. He then shines his phone's flashlight through the colored sections of the tape, which act as filters, projecting the distinct colored beams onto the wall to form a rainbow pattern."
0919-3,"No, the man does not create the rainbow by using a prism to refract light.

He creates the effect by coloring sections of clear tape with different colored markers (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple) and then shining a light source (his phone's flashlight) through the colored tape roll. The tape with the marker ink acts as a set of colored filters, projecting stripes of colored light onto the wall, rather than splitting white light via refraction as a prism would."

0924-0,The red object in the hand of the woman in the white top is a **book**. She is seen sitting in a chair and holding the open book as if reading it just before the blue liquid is splashed on her.
0924-1,"The woman in the white top is not holding any red item at the video's conclusion.

She was holding a red book while sitting and reading, but she dropped it onto the ground when she was startled by being splashed with the blue liquid."
0924-2,"No, the woman in the white top is not holding a red book at the end of the video. She drops the book onto the ground when she is splashed with the blue liquid."
0924-3,"No, the woman in the white top is not holding a red bottle at the end of the video. She was initially holding a red book while sitting, but after being splashed with blue liquid by the other woman, she reacts in shock and is no longer holding the book or anything else."
0924-7,B
0926-0,"The right hand is pulling the thread. It holds the thread taut across the palm, maintaining tension so the needle can be rubbed against it."
0926-1,"**Right hand:** The right hand, which is holding the needle, grasps the loop of thread once it passes through the eye and pulls it the rest of the way through."
0926-2,"**Answer:** No, the right hand is not responsible for pulling the thread through the needle.
**Explanation:** The right hand holds the thread taut across the left palm. The left hand moves the needle back and forth across the thread, and the friction and vibration generated by this movement cause the thread to enter the needle's eye. The right hand's role is to keep the thread stable and under tension, not to actively pull it."
0926-3,"No, the left hand is not responsible for pulling the thread through the needle. The left hand holds the needle and rubs its eye back and forth against the thread, which is held taut by the right hand. This friction causes the thread to enter the needle's eye, but the left hand does not perform the action of pulling the thread through."
0926-7,A
0927-0,"The man in black holds the child with his **left arm**. His left arm is wrapped around the child's back and under their bottom for support, keeping his right hand free."
0927-1,"The man in black uses his **left arm** to hold the child in the video.

**Explanation:** Throughout the video, the man's left arm is positioned around the child's back and under their bottom, providing the main support while his right hand is used to hold and eat the popsicle."
0927-2,"No, the man holds the child with his right arm and the popsicle with his left hand."
0927-3,"No, the man holds the child with his left arm and holds the popsicle with his right hand."

0929-0,"Both the little girl in the green dress and the little girl in the blue dress exhibit similar behaviors when interacting with the street performer disguised as a statue.

Here are the key similarities:

1.  **Approach and Touch:** Both girls curiously approach the performer while he is standing perfectly still, treating him like an actual statue, and proceed to touch him.
2.  **Startled Reaction:** When the performer makes a sudden, slight movement in response to their touch, both girls are visibly startled and surprised.
3.  **Rapid Retreat:** Immediately after being startled, both girls quickly retreat from the performer.
4.  **Seeking an Adult:** Both girls run directly towards an adult woman (presumably their guardian) after their interaction with the performer.
5.  **Emotional Response:** Both display a strong emotional reaction following the surprise – the first girl laughs while running back, and the second girl laughs/cries loudly as she runs away.

In essence, both children were intrigued by the ""statue,"" bravely interacted with it, were surprised when it proved to be alive, and sought comfort from a trusted adult afterward."
0929-1,"Both the little girl in the green dress and the little girl in the blue dress exhibit similar behaviors towards the living statue.

1.  **Curiosity and Interaction:** Both girls approach the statue, initially perceiving it as inanimate, and bravely reach out to touch it, testing its reality.
2.  **Startle Reaction:** When the statue unexpectedly moves in response to their touch, both girls are visibly startled and jump back.
3.  **Retreat and Seeking Comfort:** Immediately after being startled, both girls quickly run away from the statue towards an adult woman (presumably their guardian), seeking safety and comfort.
4.  **Mixed Emotion (Fear/Amusement):** Both girls display a mixture of fear (running away, shouting) and amusement (laughing shortly after the scare) following the interaction."
0929-2,"No, the little girls do not both try to support the statue.

**Explanation:**

1.  The little girl in the green dress reaches out towards the statue as it starts to lean forward (around 0:08), but she immediately gets scared, jumps back, and runs away. It's not a clear attempt to support its weight.
2.  The little girl in the blue dress touches the statue's arm, and when it moves towards her (around 0:24), she instantly jumps back startled and runs away laughing, making no attempt to support it."
0929-3,"Yes, both the little girl in the green dress and the little girl in the blue dress are trying to determine if the statue is real or not.

**Explanation:** Both girls approach the figure, which is a street performer posing as a statue. They physically touch the performer. When the performer makes subtle movements in response (like turning his head), both girls react with surprise and jump or run away laughing, indicating they were testing the ""statue's"" stillness and were startled to find it was a real person."

0933-0,"Based on the video provided, the man in the costume did not light a fire. He surprised the woman working on her laptop by smashing a pie (likely filled with cream) into her face as a prank."
0933-1,"The man in the costume did not start a fire in the video.

**Explanation:** The video shows the man in the costume sneaking up on a woman and smashing a pie (or whipped cream) in her face as a prank. There is no indication or evidence of a fire being started at any point in the clip."
0933-2,"No, the man in the costume did not light a fire. The video shows him sneaking up behind the woman, making a whistling sound, and then hitting her in the face with a pie or whipped cream as a prank."
0933-3,"No, the fire was not lit by the man in the costume to surprise the person being pranked. The video shows the person in the mascot costume surprising the woman by smashing what appears to be a pie or whipped cream in her face, not by lighting a fire."
0933-7,B
0939-0,"There is **one** person playing roles in the video.

**Explanation:** Although there appear to be three boys and one dad character depicted, careful observation shows that the same individual is portraying all four roles through different setups, costume changes, and editing."
0939-1,"**Answer:** There is only one individual acting in the video.
*   **Explanation:** Although the video shows multiple characters (three boys and a dad), all roles are portrayed by the same person using editing techniques."
0939-2,"Yes, it is true that only one person played all the roles in the video.

**Explanation:** All the characters shown in the video—the three boys playing games and pretending to sleep, and the ""dad"" figure who checks on them—share the exact same physical appearance, including facial features, hair, glasses, and build. This indicates that the same actor portrayed all the roles, likely using editing techniques to appear multiple times in the same scene."
0939-3,"No, there are not four different people playing roles in the video. The video features one person playing all four roles (the three boys and the dad character) through editing techniques."

0942-0,"The purpose of the man catching the egg with the side of the spatula and breaking it is twofold:

1.  **To showcase skill and entertain:** Catching a flipped egg on the narrow edge of a spatula is a difficult maneuver that demonstrates high levels of precision, control, and hand-eye coordination. It's a common teppanyaki performance trick designed to impress and entertain onlookers.
2.  **To prepare for egg art:** This specific catch allows him to immediately and precisely break the egg onto the griddle in the desired location, controlling the flow of the yolk and white to seamlessly transition into drawing the heart shape."
0942-1,"The man uses the side of the spatula to catch and break the egg primarily for **showmanship and to demonstrate exceptional skill**.

**Explanation:** Catching a tossed egg on the thin edge of a spatula requires significant hand-eye coordination and control. Breaking it cleanly this way is also part of the performance aspect common in teppanyaki cooking. Furthermore, this technique allows for a precise crack and immediate control over the egg's contents, enabling him to create the subsequent egg art (the heart shape and writing) smoothly on the griddle."
0942-2,"Yes, the man in the video is demonstrating a teppanyaki cooking technique.

**Explanation:** He skillfully uses two spatulas on a teppanyaki grill, tossing an egg with one and then catching it precisely on the edge of the other spatula to break it onto the cooking surface. This type of performative food preparation, showcasing dexterity with tools like spatulas, is characteristic of teppanyaki cooking demonstrations."
0942-3,"No, the man is not breaking the egg with the spatula primarily to show how fragile eggs are.

**Explanation:** His actions are part of a teppanyaki cooking performance. He demonstrates significant skill in handling and manipulating the egg *before* breaking it. He breaks it precisely with the spatula edge to begin cooking it and uses the liquid egg to create art (a heart shape with writing) on the grill. The focus is on his culinary skill and showmanship, not on the egg's fragility itself."

0946-0,"Based on the video, the man did not touch either of the chicken's feet after it stopped moving. Another person's hand approached the chicken's head area to erase the line in the dirt, which subsequently caused the chicken to wake up and move."
0946-1,"Based on the video, the man did not touch either of the chicken's feet when it became still. He was holding the chicken's head and neck down, pointing its beak towards a line drawn in the dirt, which induced a state of tonic immobility."
0946-2,"No, the man did not touch the chicken's left foot after it stopped moving. After the chicken became still, the man removed his hands from its upper body and head area. The chicken's feet remained tucked underneath it, and the only subsequent interaction before it moved was another person erasing the line near its head."
0946-3,"No, the man did not touch the chicken's right foot after it stopped moving.

**Explanation:** After the line is drawn and the chicken becomes still, the man keeps his hand on the chicken's back/body area. Another person's hand interacts near the chicken's head to erase the line, but neither person touches the chicken's feet during the time it is stationary."
0946-7,B
0949-0,"The boss of the company appears in two main locations in the video:

1.  **On the street (0:00 - 0:34):** He is initially disguised as a blind beggar, sitting on the sidewalk with a collection box. This is where he tests the character of the job candidates by observing how they treat him.
2.  **In the office (0:53 - 0:59):** He appears at the end, walking into the interview room after the candidates have spoken to the initial interviewer. Here, he reveals his true identity as the boss, showing that the ""test"" on the street was the real interview."
0949-1,"The company's boss appears in the following scenes:

1.  **0:00 - 0:34:** He appears disguised as a blind beggar sitting on the street. In this part, he is testing the character of people passing by, including the three individuals who later apply for the job.
2.  **0:53 - 0:59:** He appears in the office, revealing his true identity as the boss to the job candidates. This happens after the interviewer has made the hiring decision based on the earlier street interactions."
0949-2,"Yes, the boss appears at the start as a beggar and later in a suit.

**Explanation:** The video begins with a man disguised as a blind beggar on the street, observing how people treat him. Later, in an office setting during job interviews, this same man enters dressed in a business suit and reveals himself to be the boss, indicating his earlier appearance as a beggar was a test of character for the candidates."
0949-3,"**No**, the boss does not only appear at the end of the video in a suit. He is the central character shown from the beginning of the video, disguised as a blind beggar sitting on the sidewalk to test the kindness of the job applicants. He only reveals his true identity and appears in a suit during the final scene in the office."
0949-7,B
0950-0,"The ball is bouncing rapidly back and forth against the first tuning fork.

*   **Explanation:** The second time the man strikes the second tuning fork, he has removed the weight, making its frequency 260 Hz, which matches the natural frequency of the first tuning fork. The sound waves from the struck second fork cause the first fork to vibrate strongly due to resonance. This vigorous vibration of the first fork repeatedly strikes the ping pong ball, causing it to bounce rapidly."
0950-1,"Nothing happens to the ball.

Explanation: The man hits a second tuning fork with a frequency of 240 Hz. This frequency does not match the natural frequency (260 Hz) of the first tuning fork positioned next to the ball. Because the frequencies don't match, resonance is not induced, and the vibrations from the 240 Hz fork do not cause the 260 Hz fork to vibrate significantly enough to move the ball."
0950-2,"Yes, the ball remains still.

Explanation: The second time the man strikes a tuning fork, he strikes one with a frequency of 240 Hz. This frequency does not match the natural frequency (260 Hz) of the tuning fork next to the ball, so resonance is not induced, and the ball does not move."
0950-3,"**No.**

When the man strikes the second tuning fork, which initially has a frequency of 240 Hz, the ball does not move upwards. This is because its frequency does not match the natural frequency (260 Hz) of the first tuning fork next to the ball. Without matching frequencies, resonance does not occur, and the first tuning fork does not vibrate strongly enough to move the ball."

0952-0,"The third person clearly seen in the video is an adult skier who is not wearing a dress. This individual is wearing ski gear, specifically an orange/red ski jacket and black ski pants."
0952-1,"The third individual, who is the adult helping the child up, is wearing a red/orange jacket and black pants."
0952-2,"Yes, the third person in the video, who is an adult skier helping the child, is wearing an orange-black outfit. Their jacket is a bright orange/red-orange colour, while their ski pants, helmet, and gloves are black."
0952-3,"No, the third person shown in the video is an adult wearing an orange/red jacket and black ski pants, not a pink outfit. The child who falls near the beginning of the video is wearing the pink outfit."
0952-7,C
0956-0,"The rotation direction of the red stick is **counter-clockwise**.

As seen in the overhead view (around 0:03-0:12), the stick with red ends spins in a direction opposite to the way the hands on a clock move."
0956-1,The red stick rotates counter-clockwise. This is observed in the overhead view (around 0:02-0:12) where the stick spins around its central pivot point in a direction opposite to the movement of clock hands.
0956-2,"No, the red stick rotates in a counter-clockwise direction relative to the camera. When viewed from the overhead perspective in the video, the right end of the stick moves down and left, while the left end moves up and right, indicating a counter-clockwise rotation."
0956-3,"No, the red stick does not rotate in a counterclockwise direction relative to the camera.

*   **Explanation:** Observing the rotation from the top-down camera angle, the red stick spins in the same direction as the hands on a clock, which is clockwise."
0956-7,C
0957-0,"The substance (nylon), which formed at the interface between the two immiscible liquids in the beaker, was initially grabbed and pulled out as a continuous strand using tweezers. This strand was then attached to the glass rod, and the rod was rotated (or the strand guided) to wind the nylon onto it, effectively spooling it out of the beaker."
0957-1,"The process is **interfacial polymerization followed by mechanical winding**.

**Explanation:**
A chemical reaction, known as interfacial polymerization, occurs at the boundary (interface) where the two immiscible liquids (a water-based solution and a cyclohexane-based solution, each containing a different reactant) meet. This reaction forms a solid polymer, nylon, as a film at the interface. Tweezers are then used to grasp this nylon film, and as it is continuously pulled upwards, more nylon forms at the interface. This continuous strand of newly formed nylon is then wound onto the glass rod, transferring the substance from the beaker to the rod."
0957-2,"Yes, the substance in the beaker ended up on the rod by being pulled out and wrapped around it.

**Explanation:** The video shows tweezers being used to pull a stringy white substance (nylon) from the interface of the two liquids in the beaker. This substance is then continuously wound around a glass rod as more is pulled out."
0957-3,"**Answer:** No, the substance did not end up on the rod because it adhered to the rod when it was inserted.

**Explanation:** The video shows that tweezers were inserted into the beaker first. The substance (nylon) formed at the interface between the two liquids and adhered to the *tweezers* as they were pulled out. The extracted nylon was then deliberately wrapped around the separate glass rod outside the beaker. The rod itself was not inserted into the beaker to collect the substance."
0957-7,D
0973-0,"The man in the gray hoodie (MrBeast) got injured during the final stage of the obstacle course race, around the 0:41-0:42 second mark.

*   **Explanation:** After completing several obstacles, he reached the final section where participants threw small, hard objects at large hanging balloon clusters. While throwing these objects towards the blue balloon cluster, one of them ricocheted back and struck him on the forehead, causing a visible cut."
0973-1,"The man in the gray hoodie on the left (MrBeast) sustained an injury near the end of the video, specifically around the **0:41-0:42 timestamp**.

**Explanation:** This occurs during the final part of the challenge where he and others are throwing small, hard objects (like bolts or screws) at large clusters of balloons hanging from the ceiling. He visibly flinches and exclaims ""Ow!"" as one of the thrown objects apparently ricochets back and strikes him on the forehead."
0973-2,"Yes, the man in the gray hoodie on the left (identified as MrBeast) got injured during the final balloon popping game.

**Explanation:** During the final part of the game where participants threw small, hard objects at balloon clusters, some objects ricocheted back. The video shows MrBeast reacting in pain, saying ""Ow!"" and ""Hurt!"", and flinching multiple times. Immediately after the game is stopped, a close-up reveals a visible cut with blood on his forehead, confirming he was hit and injured by one of the bouncing projectiles."
0973-3,"No, the man in the gray hoodie did not get injured at the beginning of the video. He is shown actively participating in the initial stages of the obstacle course without any signs of injury. The injury occurs much later, towards the end of the video, during the segment where they are throwing small objects at balloon clusters."
0973-7,B
0974-0,"The person put the straw into the bottle at the 0:02-0:03 second mark of the video.

This happened after a hole was drilled into the side of the empty plastic bottle and immediately before hot glue was applied to seal the area around the straw. This sequence is part of the preparation phase for the magic trick shown later in the video."
0974-1,"**00:02:** At this point in the video, the person holds the empty plastic bottle in one hand and an orange straw in the other, then proceeds to insert the straw into the mouth of the bottle."
0974-2,"Yes, the person put the straw into the bottle before doing the trick. The video shows the preparation steps, including drilling a hole in the bottle, inserting a straw through the hole, and sealing it with hot glue, all before the scene where the trick is performed in public."
0974-3,"**No**, the person did not put the straw into the bottle while sitting at the table at the end of the video. The video shows the straw being inserted and glued into the bottle during a preparation phase *before* the scene at the table. While at the table, the person uses a pencil to push the pre-inserted straw *out* of the bottle as part of a magic trick."
0974-7,C
0976-0,"The man answers the question first. He incorrectly guesses ""Roads""."
0976-1,"The first person to respond to the question in the initial scene is the man on the left, wearing the beanie and glasses. He incorrectly guesses ""Roads""."
0976-2,"Yes, the person on the left (the man) was the first to answer the question in the first scene. He provided the first verbal response (""Roads"") to the puzzle, although it was incorrect."
0976-3,"No, the person on the right was not the first to answer the question in the first scene. The man on the left provided the first answer (""Roads""), although it was incorrect, before the woman on the right gave her answer (""Crossroads"")."
0976-7,D
0983-0,"The second person, who is a security guard, appears in the video to stop the first person from spray-painting graffiti on the wall.

**Explanation:** The security guard runs towards the artist, shouts, ""Hey you! You can't be doing that!"" indicating his intention is to intervene and stop the unauthorized painting, which is part of his duty to protect the property."
0983-1,"The second individual, who is a security guard, appears in the video because he observes the first individual spray-painting on the wall. The guard runs towards the artist shouting, ""Hey you! You can't be doing that!"", clearly indicating his appearance is a direct response to stop the act of painting."
0983-2,"Yes, the second person in the video is a security guard investigating the graffiti artist. This is confirmed by the word ""SECURITY"" clearly printed on the back of his jacket, and his actions of shouting at the artist to stop and then chasing him."
0983-3,"Yes, the second person in the video is actually a painted silhouette of a girl on the wall.

**Explanation:** The video shows an artist creating a mural using spray paint. The figure of the girl is painted in black directly onto the wall as part of the artwork, alongside the painted ladder and heart balloon. It is a flat, two-dimensional image and not a real person."
0983-7,A
0985-0,"**No.**

The cup is empty at the end of the video because the woman secretly removed the rolled-up bill from under the cup while the man was performing the trick. Therefore, the money initially placed under the cup is not there when the cup is lifted at the end."
0985-1,"**No**, the money in the cup at the end is not the same as the money at the start of the video.

**Explanation:** The video shows the woman discreetly swapping the bill the man placed under the cup with a different bill she was holding in her hand while his attention was diverted. Therefore, the bill revealed at the end is the one the woman switched in, not the original one."
0985-2,"No, the money did not come from the man's right ear. The video clearly shows the rolled-up money already sitting on the green table at the very beginning (0:00) before the man even covers it with the cup for the first time. The trick involves making the money reappear under the cup after the woman takes it from the table, not producing it from his ear."
0985-3,"No, the money did not stay in the cup throughout the video as it was shaken. Each time the man lifts the cup after shaking it, the rolled-up bill is shown remaining on the table surface, not inside the cup."
0985-7,B
0995-0,"**Answer:** The answer to the eighth question is ""Long overdue"".

**Explanation:** The image shows the word ""long"" placed above the word ""due"", separated by a line, which visually represents the phrase ""long overdue""."
0995-1,"**Answer:** Long overdue.

**Explanation:** The eighth puzzle displays the word ""long"" positioned directly above the word ""due"", separated by a line. This arrangement visually represents the common phrase ""Long overdue"". Both contestants correctly identified and stated this phrase simultaneously."
0995-2,"Yes, the answer to the eighth question in the video is 'long over due'.

**Explanation:** The eighth puzzle shown in the video displays the word ""long"" directly above the word ""due"", separated by a horizontal line. This visual arrangement represents the phrase ""long over due"". Both participants correctly guess this answer at the same time."
0995-3,"No, the answer to the eighth question in the video is not 'up to no good'. The eighth question presented shows the word ""long"" positioned above the word ""due"", representing the phrase ""long overdue"". The phrase 'up to no good' was the correct answer for the fifth question shown in the video."
0995-7,D
0996-0,"The third timer tool shown in the video is the **Paper Clock** prop.

**Explanation:** The video first shows an hourglass (dismissed), then introduces two inventors simultaneously: one holding a sundial prop and the other holding a paper clock prop. While shown together initially after the hourglass, the paper clock represents the third distinct time-telling concept presented to the Pharaoh after the hourglass and the sundial."
0996-1,"The third timekeeping device featured is the concept for a **pendulum clock**, represented by a round, white paper cutout with two black hands. It is presented by the second inventor (""Mobohmad"") after the hourglass and the sundial concept are shown."
0996-2,"**No.**

The third tool shown is a static paper cutout representing a clock face with hands. While the character presenting it describes his *concept* as using a pendulum swing mechanism, the object itself is just a non-functional visual aid and does not contain or use a pendulum."
0996-3,"**No**, the third timekeeping tool shown in the video is not a sundial.

**Explanation:** The third tool shown is a white, round disc with drawn hands. The character presenting it explains that his concept uses a ""pendulum swing mechanism"" to move what he calls ""hands."" This describes the basic principle of a mechanical analog clock, not a sundial, which relies on the sun casting a shadow from a gnomon onto marked lines. The video explicitly shows a sundial as the *second* tool presented."

0999-0,"He trips over the branches, falls onto his back, spins around on the ground, and then gets up on his hands and knees past the branches while making Curly's characteristic noises."
0999-1,"While imitating Curly's signature ""woo-woo-woo"" sounds, the man trips over the branches on the path and falls down. He then gets onto his hands and knees and continues the impersonation by making barking sounds (""ruff ruff"")."
0999-2,"Yes, the man playing Curly trips over a branch while walking backward, leading to a comedic fall. He is shown walking backward making Curly's signature ""woo woo woo"" sounds, catches his foot on the branch, falls onto his back, and then gets up on his hands and knees making barking sounds, all characteristic of Curly's slapstick comedy."
0999-3,"Yes, the man playing Curly trips over the branches and falls onto his back. He then gets onto his hands and knees and makes barking noises, characteristic of the character, but does not fully stand up and continue moving forward in an upright manner within the segment shown."
0999-7,B
1002-0,"The man does not catch the fourth stick. He attempts to intercept it by moving the two black batons he is holding downwards, but the stick falls past them and lands on the padded floor."
1002-1,"The man uses the black stick he is holding in his right hand to catch the fourth falling stick. He quickly positions this stick underneath the fourth stick as it drops, intercepting it mid-air."
1002-2,"Yes, the man used his foot to assist in catching the fourth stick in the first scene.

**Explanation:** After initially missing the fourth falling stick with his hand, he quickly used his left foot to kick the stick upwards off the ground, allowing him to then successfully grab it with his hand."
1002-3,"No, the man did not catch the fourth stick with his right hand. He attempted to catch the fourth stick with his left hand but missed it."
1002-7,A
1009-0,"The man reacts politely but appears slightly dejected or resigned after the visitor declines his attempt to talk about the art in both scenes.

*   **Explanation:** In both instances, when the visitor indicates they are ""just looking"" or ""ok, thank you,"" the man immediately stops his commentary. His enthusiastic expression fades slightly, replaced by a polite but less engaged smile. He physically withdraws slightly and typically places his hands behind his back, adopting a more reserved posture. This combination suggests he accepts the visitor's preference but is mildly disappointed that his attempt to share information about the art was declined."
1009-1,"In the first two scenes, after the visitors politely decline his attempts to talk about the art (they don't wave at him), the man reacts with visible, though mild, disappointment and resignation.

**Explanation:** He approaches eagerly, attempting to share information. When met with polite refusals like ""I'm just looking thank you"" or ""Oh I'm ok thank you,"" his enthusiasm visibly dampens. He stops talking, offers a brief, somewhat subdued smile, and consistently puts his hands on his hips, a posture suggesting he's momentarily let down or resigned to the fact that the visitors don't wish to engage in conversation about the art at that moment. He accepts their responses politely without pushing further."
1009-2,"No, the man does not seem disappointed and walk away after a visitor waves at him in the first two scenes.

**Explanation:** In the first two scenes of the video, the visitors politely decline the man's attempts to talk about the art verbally (""I'm just looking thank you,"" ""Oh I'm ok thank you""). No waving occurs in these scenes. The man reacts by smiling politely and stepping back slightly or putting his hands behind his back, but he does not walk away or appear overtly disappointed. Waving only occurs in the third scene, initiated by a different visitor asking a question, which makes the man smile happily, not look disappointed or leave."
1009-3,"**Yes**.

The man proactively approaches both visitors in the first two scenes, initiating conversations by pointing to the artwork and offering specific details (like the artist's age or the amount of paint used). His body language and direct approach demonstrate a clear eagerness to engage with the visitors and share information about the art on display."

1011-0,"The woman used the hose on the man because she reacted in shock and disgust, believing he had just taken a bite out of a real kitchen sponge. Unbeknownst to her at that moment, the man was pranking her using an edible Rice Krispies treat disguised to look exactly like the sponge."
1011-1,"The woman sprayed the man with the hose because he pretended to bite into and eat a blue kitchen sponge while she was washing dishes. His action shocked and disgusted her, prompting an immediate, impulsive reaction using the readily available sink sprayer, as she believed he was actually consuming a cleaning product. She was unaware it was a prank where he had disguised a Rice Krispies treat to look like the sponge."
1011-2,"Yes, the woman used the hose on the man because she thought he had bitten into the actual dish sponge.

**Explanation:** The man took what looked exactly like the blue dish sponge the woman was using, put it in his mouth, and bit down. Her shocked reaction and immediate use of the sink hose to spray his mouth indicate she believed he had just ingested the real sponge, likely containing soap and dirt, and was trying to rinse it out quickly."
1011-3,"Yes, the woman sprayed the man with the hose as a playful response to a prank he played on her.

*   **Explanation:** The man pretended to bite into a kitchen sponge, shocking the woman. She immediately reacted by grabbing the sink's spray hose and spraying him with water. This sequence indicates her action was a direct, playful retaliation to his prank, where he had actually prepared a lookalike sponge made from a Rice Krispies treat."

1018-0,"The rapper reacts calmly and seems amused by the interruption.

**Explanation:** He immediately stops rapping when the traffic controller takes the microphone, listens patiently to the safety announcement without resisting or arguing, and even smiles before accepting the microphone back. He doesn't show annoyance or try to escalate the situation."
1018-1,"The rapper responded calmly and cooperatively when the traffic controller took his microphone.

**Explanation:** He immediately stopped rapping, showed no resistance, and allowed the traffic controller to use the microphone to make a safety announcement. The rapper listened patiently and then calmly took the microphone back to continue his performance once the controller was finished."
1018-2,"**Yes**, the rapper continued his performance calmly after the traffic controller took his microphone.

**Explanation:** After the traffic controller used the microphone to make a safety announcement and handed it back, the rapper took it without any visible signs of anger or frustration. He immediately resumed his rapping performance smoothly and appeared composed throughout the interaction."
1018-3,"No, the rapper did not get angry when the traffic controller took his microphone. While he did stop performing momentarily, it was because the traffic controller needed to use the microphone to make a safety announcement, asking people to clear the street. The rapper appeared calm and cooperative during the interruption, yielding the microphone without protest."
1018-7,A
1020-0,"The baby looks at the dad with a relatively neutral and calm expression.

**Explanation:** When the mom turns the baby to face the dad, the baby looks directly at him but doesn't smile, reach out, or show the clear excitement seen when interacting with the mom (reaching) or the big brother (big smile). The reaction is observant but lacks a strong outward display of emotion."
1020-1,"The baby responds with a neutral, observant stare when seeing their father.

**Explanation:** The baby looks directly at the father with focused attention but does not smile, laugh, or reach out, displaying a much more subdued and emotionally neutral reaction compared to the excitement shown towards the mother (reaching) and the big brother (smiling/laughing)."
1020-2,"Yes, the baby shows a lack of excitement when seeing their dad compared to the other family members shown.

**Explanation:** When the baby sees their mom, they reach out. When the baby sees their big brother, they break into a large smile and laugh. However, when the baby sees their dad, they maintain a relatively neutral expression and do not display the same clear signs of excitement."
1020-3,"**No.**

The baby looks at the dad with a relatively neutral or calm expression. There isn't a noticeable smile, giggle, or excited movement, especially when contrasted with the clear joy and laughter displayed when the baby sees the big brother later in the video."
1020-7,C
1023-0,"After the first woman politely states, ""I'm just looking thank you,"" the man's reaction is one of polite acceptance mixed with slight disappointment.

**Explanation:** His initial enthusiastic expression fades slightly, he gives a small nod and a polite, somewhat subdued smile, and looks down briefly before the clip cuts. He doesn't push the conversation further, indicating he accepts her response, but the subtle shift in his demeanor suggests mild disappointment that his attempt to engage about the art wasn't reciprocated."
1023-1,"The man stopped talking and pointing at the painting. His facial expression changed from enthusiastic to slightly disappointed or dejected, and he lowered his gaze briefly, accepting her polite refusal to engage in conversation about the art."
1023-2,"No, the man did not show clear signs of frustration. While his initial enthusiastic smile faded slightly and he briefly looked down after the woman politely declined to talk, his reaction appeared more like mild disappointment or simply accepting her response rather than annoyance or frustration. He maintained a polite demeanor and didn't display any tense body language or negative gestures."
1023-3,"**No**, the man did not seem happy and excited after the first woman spoke to him. His initial enthusiastic expression faded, and he looked down slightly, appearing somewhat disappointed or deflated by her polite dismissal (""I'm just looking thank you"")."
1023-7,A
1031-0,"The man is experiencing **shock and disbelief**.

**Explanation:** His facial expressions, including widening eyes, an open mouth, and eventually covering his mouth, clearly show his astonishment and inability to comprehend the escalating multi-million dollar bids for an artwork that is essentially a banana taped to a wall – visually identical to the banana he is casually eating for lunch. The absurdity of the situation and the astronomical prices being called out by the auctioneer elicit a strong reaction of shock and disbelief."
1031-1,"The man in the white shirt is experiencing **shock and disbelief**.

**Explanation:** His facial expressions, including wide eyes and an open mouth, along with his increasingly stunned posture as the auction bids escalate, clearly indicate that he is shocked and finds it unbelievable that an artwork consisting of a banana taped to a wall (identical to the one he possesses) is selling for millions of dollars."
1031-2,"**Yes**, the man in the white shirt holding a banana is feeling surprised and shocked by the banana auction.

**Explanation:** His facial expressions clearly show increasing astonishment as the auction bids escalate dramatically. His eyes widen progressively, he leans forward intently, and ultimately covers his mouth in disbelief when the price reaches over five million dollars for the banana artwork, contrasting sharply with the ordinary banana he holds."
1031-3,"No, the man is not calm and relaxed. His facial expressions, particularly his wide eyes and increasingly shocked look as he listens to the escalating auction bids for the banana artwork, indicate astonishment and disbelief rather than calmness."

1044-0,"The person is primarily experiencing a **startle response** coupled with **confusion and disorientation**.

**Explanation:** They were abruptly woken from sleep by loud, unexpected auditory stimuli (the game sounds via headphones). This triggers an involuntary startle reflex (seen in their wide eyes and sudden alertness). Immediately following this, they exhibit confusion and disorientation as their brain tries to make sense of the bizarre and unexpected situation – being awake, in bed, but holding a game controller and hearing intense action sounds."
1044-1,"The person under the quilt appears **startled, confused, and surprised**.

**Explanation:** He was abruptly woken from sleep by loud video game sounds played directly into his ears via headphones placed on him while he slept. His wide-eyed expression and the way he looks around indicate he is suddenly alert but disoriented and trying to process the unexpected and intense situation he instantly found himself in upon waking."
1044-2,"Yes, the person under the quilt is surprised and confused about what is happening.

They were sound asleep and were abruptly woken by loud video game sounds played directly into their ears via headphones placed on them while they slept. Upon waking, they have a startled, wide-eyed expression and look around in a disoriented manner, clearly confused by the sudden noise and the unexpected situation of holding a controller and wearing headphones."
1044-3,"**No**, the person under the quilt was asleep. The video shows another person placing headphones on the sleeping individual and then starting a loud video game, which abruptly wakes them up. Their startled reaction indicates they were not playing or engrossed in the game beforehand."

1045-0,"The older boy hugs the younger boy as an immediate reaction to comfort and reassure him after the younger boy becomes visibly shocked and scared by the prank reveal (the fake bloody hand impaled by a pencil).

He lets the younger boy go shortly after their mother enters the room and asks if they are okay. The older boy, while trying to downplay the situation for his mother by saying they are having a ""great time,"" releases the hug, likely to appear more casual and signal the intense moment of the scare is over, even though the younger boy is still affected."
1045-1,"The person on the left embraces the individual in the tie-dye hoodie primarily as an instinctive reaction to stop him from falling backward after being startled by the prank reveal. He releases him almost immediately upon noticing their mother entering the room, needing to quickly downplay the situation and assure her that they were just having fun."
1045-2,"Yes, the person on the left hugged the one in the tie-dye hoodie to prevent their mother from discovering that his brother fainted.

The hug occurred immediately after the younger brother fainted from the prank and precisely as their mother entered the room. While holding his brother, the older one quickly reassured their mother that they were ""having a great time,"" which was clearly an attempt to conceal the fainting incident that had just happened."
1045-3,"No, the hug was not a celebration of a successful magic trick.

**Explanation:** The event shown was a prank, not a magic trick. The older boy used fake blood and a pencil to simulate a gruesome injury, intending to scare the younger boy. The younger boy's reaction was one of shock and fear, not amazement. The subsequent hug was initiated by the older boy immediately after the scare, appearing more as a way to grab or steady the startled younger boy rather than a mutual celebration."
1045-7,A
1046-0,"The person wearing the black hat threw the person in the gray T-shirt into the swimming pool as retaliation.

**Explanation:** Earlier in the video, the person (at that time wearing a black shirt, later changing into the gray T-shirt) pushed the man wearing the black hat into the pool. After getting out, the man in the hat chased down the person who pushed him and, upon confronting him, threw him into the pool as payback."
1046-1,"The person in the black hat tossed the individual in the gray T-shirt into the pool as **retaliation or payback**.

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows that moments before, the individual (who was then wearing a black shirt before quickly changing to a gray one) pushed the man in the black hat into the pool. The man in the hat then got out, chased down the individual, and tossed him into the pool in direct response to being pushed in first."
1046-2,"Yes, the person in the black hat threw the person in the gray T-shirt into the pool because they were pushed in earlier by the same person.

The video first shows the person (initially wearing a black shirt, later a gray T-shirt) pushing the person in the black hat into the pool. The person in the hat then gets out, chases the other person down, confronts them, and subsequently throws them into the pool in retaliation."
1046-3,"No, the reason the person in the black hat threw the person in the gray T-shirt into the pool was not because it was a prank he initiated. It was retaliation because the person in the gray T-shirt (who was wearing a black shirt moments before) had pushed him into the pool first."
1046-7,C
1049-0,"The person wants to express the initiation of a planned comedic skit.

*   **Explanation:** The sequence begins with the person watching a video of the action on their phone, indicating premeditation. They then get up and replicate the action (hitting the dog lightly with a slipper). This act serves as a cue within a staged scenario, causing the dog to approach Khaby Lame, which in turn sets up Khaby's signature comedic reaction. The entire interaction is clearly performed for entertainment and is not an expression of genuine annoyance or aggression towards the dog."
1049-1,"The intention behind the person tapping the dog with the slipper is to give the dog a trained cue or command.

**Explanation:** The dog immediately responds to the tap by getting up, walking to the light switch, and jumping at it, indicating this is a learned behavior triggered by the slipper tap. The person intends for the dog to perform this specific action of turning off the light."
1049-2,"Yes, the person tapped the dog with a slipper, which prompted the dog to get up and turn off the light switch. However, the video shows a gentle tap used as a physical cue or command, rather than a forceful hit intended to cause harm. The dog appears trained to respond to this specific action."
1049-3,"**No**, the person was not expressing frustration or annoyance by hitting the dog with the slipper.

**Explanation:** The video shows the person tapping the dog very gently with the slipper. The force used was minimal, appearing more like a soft nudge or prompt to get the dog's attention and encourage it to move, rather than a forceful hit driven by negative emotions like frustration or annoyance."
1049-7,B
1051-0,"The man in black bites his hand to recreate the pose he held as a baby in the old photograph shown immediately after. It's a way to directly reference that past moment, showing the continuity of their relationship, expressing nostalgia, and creating a touching and humorous parallel between his childhood and the present day while sitting on the older man's lap again."
1051-1,"The man in black is recreating a pose from his childhood photo shown moments earlier in the video.

**Explanation:** The video displays an old photograph where the man, as a baby being held by the older gentleman, is biting his hand. Immediately after, in the present day, the man playfully mimics this exact action while sitting on the older man's lap, connecting the present moment to that past memory."
1051-2,"Yes, the man in black is mimicking his childhood actions shown in the photo.

**Explanation:** The video shows the man sitting on the older man's lap and bringing his hand up to his mouth area, laughing. This action directly mirrors the subsequent photograph, which shows him as a baby sitting on the same man's lap with his hand near his mouth. The sequence clearly indicates he is recreating the pose from his childhood picture."
1051-3,"Yes, the man in black is expressing nostalgia or sentimentality by biting his hand.

**Explanation:** The gesture occurs immediately after the video transitions from a lighthearted present moment with the elderly man to an old photograph showing the same man much younger, holding the man in black as a baby. This sudden confrontation with a past memory, highlighting the passage of time and the enduring relationship, triggers a strong emotional response. Biting his hand appears to be an involuntary reaction to being overwhelmed by these nostalgic and sentimental feelings evoked by the photograph."
1051-7,C
1053-0,"The man in the black T-shirt is pushing back his *hood*, not raising a hat. By pushing back his hood and smiling, he appears to be playfully revealing his face to acknowledge or greet the person walking down the aisle (possibly the person filming), expressing friendliness and recognition."
1053-1,"The man in the black T-shirt is lifting the hood of his hoodie, not a separate hat.

He appears to be conveying playful acknowledgment or amusement towards the man sitting next to him. The quick lift of the hood, combined with his smile directed at his companion, suggests a lighthearted, non-verbal interaction or reaction, possibly related to the people walking by or a shared joke between them."
1053-2,"No, the man in the black T-shirt is not raising a hat. He is repeatedly pulling his *hood* over his head as passengers walk by, apparently in an attempt to make the middle seat seem occupied or to discourage others from sitting there by appearing asleep or unapproachable."
1053-3,"No, the man in the black T-shirt is not raising a hat to greet someone. He is wearing a hoodie and briefly adjusts the hood, pulling it slightly forward and then pushing it back while smiling and interacting with the person seated next to him, not acknowledging someone in the aisle."
1053-7,A
1055-0,"The enlightenment value of this video is primarily as a cautionary tale. It demonstrates the potential negative emotional consequences of pranks that simulate serious harm, highlighting how actions intended as jokes can cause genuine distress and regret, thereby underscoring the importance of considering the impact of one's actions on others."
1055-1,"The educational or insightful takeaway from this video is the significant danger associated with misusing household appliances and the potential for pranks to have serious, unintended consequences.

**Brief Explanation:** The video depicts a young man faking a severe injury by pretending to put his hand in a blender (using ketchup for effect). While the initial injury is staged, the prank causes extreme shock to another person, apparently leading to them fainting or getting hurt, requiring care afterward. This illustrates that even fake stunts involving dangerous equipment can lead to real harm or distress due to unpredictable reactions, underscoring the importance of appliance safety and thinking through the potential outcomes of seemingly harmless jokes."
1055-2,"No, the video does not have a high enlightenment value due to its humorous depiction of a prank.

**Explanation:** While the video might initially seem like a prank setup involving ketchup and a blender, it quickly escalates into a shocking and dangerous situation where the individual puts their hand into the running appliance, resulting in apparent injury and distress. The subsequent scenes show concern and regret, not humor. The video's value lies more in being a cautionary example of dangerous behavior rather than providing enlightenment through humor, as the humor is overshadowed by the alarming accident."
1055-3,"Yes, the enlightenment value is low because the video primarily focuses on a slapstick accident/prank involving ketchup and a blender, which is intended for entertainment or shock rather than education or intellectual stimulation. The content revolves around a messy mishap and the immediate, dramatic reaction, lacking deeper substance or informative qualities."
1055-7,D
1064-0,"The man is surprised because after running away and then returning close to the firework, it malfunctioned and unexpectedly shot sparks directly at him, hitting him around the head and hair area just before the anticipated main explosion."
1064-1,"The man's surprise is caused by the firework fuse suddenly shooting a burst of sparks directly towards his face.

**Explanation:** After lighting the fuse and running away, the man returns and crouches near the firework, covering his ears. He is surprised because, instead of the expected main explosion, the fuse itself unexpectedly erupts, sending sparks aggressively towards him at close range, catching him completely off guard."
1064-2,"**No**, the man is not surprised because he ended up back at the bomb site.

**Explanation:** The video shows the man intentionally running a path that leads him back to the location of the firework after initially running away. His surprise occurs when he returns and realizes the fuse is still burning and the large firework is about to explode right next to him. His shock is due to the imminent danger and perhaps misjudging the fuse time, not because he is unexpectedly back at the starting point."
1064-3,"No, the man does not appear surprised because the firework exploded unexpectedly.

**Explanation:** Lighting a large firework, especially one labeled ""BOMB,"" makes an explosion the expected outcome. The man's actions, such as running far away after lighting the fuse and then returning to crouch near it with exaggerated expressions, suggest he anticipated the explosion and his reaction was performative for comedic effect rather than genuine surprise at an unforeseen event."
1064-7,C
1075-0,"The video splices together shots of Peter Parker (the ordinary man) and Spider-Man to emphasize the **duality of his existence and the personal sacrifices** required by his superhero responsibilities.

*   **Explanation:** The editing contrasts Peter's everyday struggles, desires (like his relationship with MJ), and vulnerabilities with the lonely burden and duties of being Spider-Man. It visually highlights his internal conflict and shows how his life as Spider-Man prevents him from achieving the normalcy and happiness he wants as Peter Parker."
1075-1,"The purpose of splicing together shots of Peter Parker's ordinary life and his life as Spider-Man is to highlight the stark contrast and inherent conflict between his two identities.

This editing technique emphasizes the duality of his existence: the struggles, awkwardness, and unfulfilled desires of Peter Parker (missing out on moments with MJ, facing everyday frustrations and failures) are juxtaposed against the immense responsibility, isolation, and sacrifices required of Spider-Man. It visually represents his internal turmoil and the heavy personal cost of being a hero, making the audience empathize with his struggle to reconcile his personal wants and needs with his sense of duty."
1075-2,"Yes, the video splices shots of Peter Parker's ordinary life and his Spider-Man identity to highlight the exclusion and difficulties he faces as an ordinary person.

**Explanation:**

The editing juxtaposes scenes where Peter Parker experiences social awkwardness, bullying (""Watch it, jerk!"", ""What are you stupid?""), professional disrespect (being yelled at by Jameson), and romantic disappointment (watching Mary Jane with another man) with imagery associated with Spider-Man. This contrast emphasizes the struggles, powerlessness, and feelings of exclusion Peter endures in his everyday life, which are often a direct or indirect consequence of his responsibilities and sacrifices as Spider-Man. The voiceover (""Am I not supposed to have what I want? What I need?"") further reinforces this theme, linking his inability to achieve normal happiness and inclusion to his dual identity."
1075-3,"**No**, the video is not simply suggesting they are the same person. The clips are taken from the Spider-Man films where it is the established narrative that the character Peter Parker (the ordinary person shown, played by Tobey Maguire) is also the superhero Spider-Man. The splicing is used to highlight the contrast, conflict, and emotional weight of this character living a dual life, assuming the viewer already knows they are the same individual."
1075-7,D
1080-0,"The man peels the carrot using a standard vegetable peeler to demonstrate that a simple, readily available tool already exists for this task. He does **not** seem amazed; his reaction is one of exasperation or mockery, highlighting the unnecessary complexity of modifying a spoon to peel the carrot, as shown in the first part of the video, when a perfectly functional peeler provides an easy and obvious solution."
1080-1,"The man peels the carrot using a standard vegetable peeler to demonstrate a simple and efficient alternative to the unnecessarily complicated method of modifying a spoon shown previously. His expression is not one of amazement, but his signature deadpan, exasperated reaction, used comedically to highlight the absurdity and pointlessness of the complex ""life hack"" by presenting the obvious, common-sense solution."
1080-2,"Yes, the man is reacting with bewildered exasperation because the previous person went through the unnecessary and complicated trouble of modifying a spoon with a grinder to peel a carrot, when a simple, readily available tool like a vegetable peeler achieves the same result effortlessly. His demonstration with the standard peeler and subsequent signature gesture highlight the absurdity and inefficiency of the first method."
1080-3,"No, the man did not feel surprised.

He peeled the carrot using a standard vegetable peeler to demonstrate a much simpler and readily available alternative to the complicated process of modifying a spoon into a peeler shown earlier in the video. His unimpressed expression and gestures are characteristic of his comedic style, mocking overly complex ""life hacks"" by presenting the obvious, easier solution."
1080-7,C
1081-0,"The little green bricks represent **mouthwash**.

In the video, the person demonstrating the oral hygiene routine explicitly states, ""Next, we use some mouthwash,"" right before pouring the green bricks into the LEGO mimic's mouth, shaking it to simulate swishing, and then emptying them out."
1081-1,"The small green bricks represent mouthwash. In the video, the presenter uses them as part of the LEGO brick mimic's oral hygiene routine, pouring them into the mouth, shaking the mimic to simulate swishing, and then pouring them out to simulate spitting, just before the brushing step."
1081-2,"Yes, the little green bricks in the video represent mouthwash. The person demonstrating the cleaning routine explicitly states, ""Next, we use some mouthwash"" while holding the container of green bricks, and then simulates using it by pouring the bricks into the LEGO mouth, shaking it, and pouring them out."
1081-3,"No, the little green bricks in the video do not represent grass. They represent mouthwash as part of the LEGO brick mimic's oral hygiene routine, demonstrated by being poured into the mouth, swished around, and then spit out."
1081-7,C
1087-0,"**The circle on the left is not actually moving.**

**Explanation:** The video demonstrates an optical illusion. While the changing colors and the arrow inside the circle create a strong perception that the circle is moving in the direction the arrow points (right, down, left, up, etc.), the narrator explains and it becomes clear if you focus or cover the arrow that the circle itself remains stationary throughout the video. The perceived motion is a trick of the brain."
1087-1,"**Clockwise:** The arrow inside the left circle rotates clockwise. The optical illusion makes the circle *appear* to move in the direction the arrow is pointing at any given moment, resulting in a perceived clockwise movement pattern (right, down, left, up, repeat)."
1087-2,"**True.**

The circle on the left does not actually move. The apparent shifting is an optical illusion known as induced motion. The changing direction of the arrow inside the circle tricks your brain into perceiving the entire circle as moving, even though its position remains fixed. As demonstrated in the video, covering the arrow reveals that the circle itself is stationary."
1087-3,"**No**, the circle on the left does not actually move. As explained and demonstrated in the video, the perception of movement in the direction of the arrow is an optical illusion; the circle itself remains stationary."
1087-7,C
1090-0,"From the perspective of the sheep in the video, the person's painting on the ground looks like a real, three-dimensional obstacle or barrier, possibly resembling a bridge structure with gaps or a hole in the road.

**Explanation:** The sheep hesitate upon reaching the drawing and then actively choose to walk around it on the sides of the path, rather than attempting to walk straight across the painted area. This avoidance behavior indicates they perceive the 2D optical illusion as a physical impediment or a potentially dangerous change in the terrain (like a drop-off or hole) that they cannot or should not cross."
1090-1,"The painting on the ground appears as a physical barrier or obstacle with depth and potential gaps/holes to the sheep.

**Explanation:** The sheep hesitate when they reach the drawing and then actively choose to walk around the edges of the path rather than stepping onto the painted area. This behavior indicates they perceive the 3D optical illusion not as a flat drawing, but as a real structure or hazard blocking their way, successfully tricking their depth perception."
1090-2,"**Yes**, the painting on the ground appears to look like a broken bridge or a significant obstacle to the sheep.

**Explanation:** The sheep hesitate when they reach the painted area and actively avoid walking directly over the drawing. Instead, they bunch up and choose to go around the sides of the path, indicating they perceive the optical illusion as a real gap, hole, or hazard similar to a broken bridge."
1090-3,"**No.**

The painting on the ground is a 3D optical illusion designed to look like a bridge or structure with gaps or holes underneath, creating a sense of depth. The sheep hesitate and actively walk around the drawing, indicating they perceive it as an obstacle, a drop, or an impassable barrier, rather than a flat surface of water like a puddle."
1090-7,D
1091-0,"Based on dual perception, **4** people can be identified.

**Explanation:**

1.  There are **three** distinct individual figures clearly depicted: a woman sitting on a bench reading, an older robed man standing behind her, and a smaller figure walking in the background landscape.
2.  The painting is also an optical illusion where the arrangement of these figures and the surrounding elements (like the archway) combine to form the **large face of an old man**.

Therefore, considering both the individual figures and the emergent illusion face, a total of four human forms can be identified."
1091-1,"Three individuals are visible in the final segment of the video.

*   A woman with reddish-blonde hair, wearing a white dress, is seated on a bench in the foreground, reading a book.
*   An older man with a long grey beard, wearing dark, hooded robes and holding a book, stands behind the bench.
*   Another woman, wearing a light-colored dress, stands further back on a path near a building in the background landscape."
1091-2,"No, I cannot confirm the presence of the three people *exactly* as described.

**Explanation:**

While there are indeed three human figures visible in the painting:
1.  A person (woman) is sitting on a bench reading a book.
2.  Another person (man with a beard) is standing behind her wearing dark clothing.

However, the third figure described does not match the painting. The third figure is:
*   Far in the background, not standing next to the man in dark clothing.
*   Appears to be a woman wearing a light-colored (likely white or off-white) dress, not a man dressed in pink with a hat."
1091-3,"**False**. While there is a woman sitting on a bench and a man standing behind her, a third person can also be identified walking on the path in the background of the painting."
1091-7,B
1095-0,"The person throws a small stone into the blue bucket (not a keg).

**Explanation:** This action creates a splash in the water. This splash is filmed as a separate element and is later combined with the footage of the person (Clips 2 & 3) in the ""Final Result"" to create the illusion that the miniature version of the person is jumping into or interacting with the water in the bucket. It's a practical effect used to complete the forced perspective visual trick."
1095-1,"The person threw a small stone into the bucket primarily **to test the visual effect of a splash on camera and check the framing/focus.**

**Explanation:** Since the final result involves a person appearing to splash inside the bucket (using forced perspective), the person setting up the shot (in Clip 1) likely tossed the stone as a quick test. This allows them to see how a splash looks with the current camera angle, ensure the focus is correct on the bucket area, and confirm that the splash action is properly captured within the frame before filming the main subject for the final illusion."
1095-2,"Yes, the person in the upper left corner (Clip 1) dropped a small stone into the blue bucket (not a keg) to create a visual effect.

**Explanation:** Clip 1 shows the person dropping an object into the water-filled bucket. The ""Final Result"" panel shows another person seemingly inside the bucket with a large splash. This splash is disproportionate to the size of the bucket and the person, indicating it was created separately, likely by the stone drop shown in Clip 1, and then combined through video editing to create the illusion of the person jumping in."
1095-3,"No, the person throwing the stone does not cause the other person to appear inside the bucket. The video uses editing techniques, likely cutting between the shot of the stone being thrown and a separate shot of the second person already sitting in the bucket, to create a visual trick or illusion."
1095-7,C
1101-0,"The man gradually submerged the piece of paper under water to carefully position and stabilize it for a video shoot. This allowed him to anchor the stick holding the cutout into the riverbed, ensuring the image of the goddess Durga stood upright at the desired depth, creating the visual effect of her being present in the river for the final shot."
1101-1,"The man slowly dipped the piece of paper into the water primarily **to achieve a specific visual effect and control the placement for the camera shot.**

**Explanation:**

1.  **Precise Positioning:** Slow movement allowed him to carefully place the paper cutout exactly at the water's surface, creating the illusion that the goddess figure was standing or floating on the water for the low-angle camera shot.
2.  **Minimize Disturbance:** Dipping it slowly prevented creating large ripples or splashes, which would have disturbed the water surface and potentially ruined the serene visual effect desired for the shot.
3.  **Protect the Paper:** Paper becomes fragile quickly when wet. Slow, controlled immersion minimized immediate water saturation and potential damage (tearing, disintegration) before the shot could be taken."
1101-2,"No, the man did not submerge the paper gradually to create an emerging effect. The video shows him carefully placing the paper cutout, which is attached to a stick, directly *into* the water to position it for the final shot. The effect seen in the final part of the video is achieved by this placement combined with a low camera angle, not by simulating emergence through gradual submersion."
1101-3,"No, the purpose of slowly submerging the paper was not to make it completely wet. The slow, partial submersion was done to carefully position the cutout and anchor its base (the stick) in the riverbed, allowing the figure to stand upright in the water while keeping the main image visible for filming or photography."
1101-7,C
1111-0,"The woman in the maroon saree decided to sit down after standing up instead of joining the dance.

*   **Explanation:** As the man begins dancing and encourages the women to join, the woman in the maroon saree leans forward and slightly lifts herself from the seated position. However, she then settles back down onto the wall while the woman next to her in the white saree gets up to dance."
1111-1,"The woman in the maroon/red saree chose to sit back down after initially standing up instead of participating in the dance.

*   **Explanation:** When the dancer approaches the group, the woman sitting second from the left (wearing the maroon/red saree) begins to rise from her seat. However, as the dancer turns his attention to the woman next to her (in the white saree) and pulls her up to dance, the woman in the maroon saree sits back down."
1111-2,"Yes, the woman in the brown and red sari initially started to stand up from the ledge but then sat back down instead of joining the dance, while the woman next to her in the white patterned sari got up to dance with the man."
1111-3,"No, the man in the white shirt did not decide to sit down after standing up. He was already seated at the beginning of the video and remained seated throughout the entire clip, observing the interaction."
1111-7,D
1112-0,"The friend in the blue shirt took the firework.

**Explanation:** The video shows two men setting up the firework under a bucket. When they run for cover, the man in the blue shirt runs into the small brick building, while the man in the pink shirt runs away. The man in the pink shirt returns to check under the bucket and finds only the lighter, indicating the firework is missing. The narration confirms that his friend (the one in the blue shirt who went into the building) had taken the firework."
1112-1,"The man in the blue shirt picked up the firework instead of the lighter.

**Explanation:** Both men initially lit the firework under the bucket. When they ran for cover, the man in the blue shirt ran into the small brick building, while the man in the pink shirt ran away but stayed outside. The man in the pink shirt later returned to the bucket and found only the lighter, indicating the firework was missing. The explosion then occurred inside the building where the man in the blue shirt was hiding, confirming he had taken the firework with him."
1112-2,"Yes, it was the person in the blue shirt who took the firework instead of the lighter.

**Explanation:**

The video includes a flashback sequence that explicitly shows the person in the blue shirt grabbing the firework while the other person places only the lighter under the bucket before they both run. Later, the explosion occurs inside the structure where the person in the blue shirt hid, and he emerges covered in soot, confirming he had the firework with him."
1112-3,"No, it was not the person in the white/pink shirt who took the firework.

**Explanation:** The video shows the person in the white/pink shirt running away from the bucket with his friend (in the blue shirt). Later, the person in the white/pink shirt cautiously returns and lifts the bucket, only to find the lighter underneath, indicating the firework is missing. The subsequent explosion occurs where the friend in the blue shirt was hiding, and that friend emerges covered in soot, confirming he was the one who had taken the firework."

1117-0,"The man in the blue shirt made the water overflow and failed the challenge. He added the final drop of water which broke the surface tension of the already overfilled glass, causing it to spill."
1117-1,"The man in the blue shirt was responsible for the water overflowing and losing the challenge. He was the last person to add water, and the drops he added caused the surface tension holding the domed water above the rim to break, resulting in the spill."
1117-2,"Yes, it was the person in the blue shirt who caused the water to overflow and failed the challenge. The video shows the water level already domed above the rim due to surface tension. During the blue-shirted person's turn (around 0:47-0:50), he adds the final drops or causes the vibration that breaks the surface tension, resulting in the water spilling over the edge."
1117-3,"**No**, the person in the red shirt did not make the water overflow and fail the challenge.

*   **Explanation:** The video shows the person in the red shirt successfully adding water without causing it to spill during their turn (around 0:40-0:45). The water overflows only after the next person, the one wearing the blue shirt, adds more water (around 0:49-0:50). Therefore, the person in the blue shirt failed the challenge."
1117-7,D
1119-0,"The bowl is on the floor next to the person in red.
Explanation: When the person in red reacted to the picture by falling backward off the couch, the bowl they were holding flew from their lap and landed on the dark wooden floor near where the person fell, amidst spilled popcorn."
1119-1,"When the person in red responds to the image, the bowl is on the floor next to him.

**Explanation:** The person in red was startled by the phone illusion, causing him to fall backward off the couch and drop the bowl, spilling the popcorn. He responds while lying on the floor, with the dropped bowl beside him amidst the scattered popcorn."
1119-2,"No, there is no iron bowl on the floor under the oversized phone screen when the person in red reacts. The person was holding a light-colored bowl of popcorn, which spilled onto the floor when he fell, but the bowl itself is not visible under the screen, and it did not appear to be made of iron."
1119-3,"No, the bowl is not on the lap of the person in red when they react to the cat and dog picture.

The bowl appears to be a light-colored popcorn bowl, not iron. Furthermore, as the person reacts by falling backward off the couch, the bowl is knocked off their lap and flies into the air, scattering popcorn."

1121-0,"The symbol closest to the filament light bulb in the control panel is the **cloud symbol**.

**Explanation:** In the video, when the inside of the cloud is shown (around 0:09), the control panel is revealed. The glowing filament light bulb is positioned directly above the orange-colored segment of the panel, which features white cloud icons."
1121-1,The symbol nearest to the filament light bulb on the control panel is the **cloud symbol**. This is because the light bulb is positioned directly above the section of the control panel that depicts clouds.
1121-2,"Yes, the symbol closest to the filament light bulb on the control panel is three clouds.

**Explanation:** When the man climbs the ladder and the view goes inside the cloud, a control panel is visible. To the immediate right of the glowing filament light bulb, there is an orange section on the panel which clearly shows three white cloud symbols."
1121-3,"No, the symbol closest to the filament light bulb on the control panel is not the sun. It is a symbol representing clouds, depicted as white clouds on an orange background. The sun symbol is yellow and located further to the right on the panel."

1122-0,"At the end of the video, the little man in the overalls with the white bag is being sucked into the vacuum cleaner hose.

**Explanation:** The final moments of the miniature scene show the vacuum cleaner hose descending and pulling the man, along with the dust bunnies, off his feet and directly into the nozzle."
1122-1,"At the conclusion of the video, the little man in overalls with the white bag ends up inside the vacuum cleaner.

He is shown being sucked directly into the vacuum cleaner hose nozzle just before the scene cuts back to the larger man holding the vacuum."
1122-2,"**Yes**, the little man in overalls with the white bag appears to end up inside the vacuum cleaner.

**Explanation:** The video shows the miniature scene under the couch where the man looks up in terror as the vacuum cleaner nozzle descends. He is then shown being pulled upwards towards the nozzle by the suction force just before the scene cuts back to the person vacuuming in the real world. This visual sequence strongly implies that he was sucked into the vacuum cleaner."
1122-3,"No, the little man in overalls with the white bag is not found inside the janitor's closet at the end of the video.

He emerges from the janitor's closet earlier in the sequence. At the end of the miniature scene, he is standing outside the closet amidst oversized debris, reacting in fear to the large vacuum cleaner hose descending towards him, just before the video cuts back to the person vacuuming in the real world."

1124-0,"The egg is inside the water bottle. The performer applied a quick downward force on the egg, pushing it through the bottle's opening and into the water inside."
1124-1,"The egg falls directly into the water bottle.

*   Explanation: The performer applies a quick, sharp force (a slap) to the side of the *bottle*, not directly to the egg. This rapid movement displaces the bottle sideways. Due to inertia, the egg resists this sudden horizontal motion and remains momentarily suspended in the air above the opening. Gravity then pulls the egg straight down, causing it to fall into the bottle."
1124-2,"**No.**

**Explanation:** After the performer's hand pushes down towards the egg, the egg disappears from the top of the water bottle. The video does not show the egg resting behind the water bottle, nor is it visibly held in the performer's hand. The action appears to be a sleight-of-hand trick where the egg is quickly removed from view, likely concealed by the performer's hand."
1124-3,"Yes, the egg ended up inside the water bottle after the performer pushed it. The quick downward push forced the egg directly into the bottle's opening, causing it to fall inside, which is confirmed by the splash of water seen immediately after the push."
1124-7,A
1127-0,"From the perspective of the camera in the third segment (around 0:07):

1.  **Ball Shooter:** The shooter is positioned in the foreground, slightly to the right of the center of the frame.
    *   *Explanation:* He is closer to the camera and occupies the lower right portion of the view as he prepares for the shot.
2.  **Target Basket:** The target basket (the smaller one he aims at) is located in the mid-ground, towards the left side of the frame.
    *   *Explanation:* It is further away from the camera than the shooter and situated to the shooter's left."
1127-1,"From the camera's viewpoint in the third segment (around 0:07-0:10), the ball shooter is positioned in the foreground/mid-ground, facing away from the camera. The target basket (the smaller, closer one he shoots at) is located directly in front of him in the mid-ground, further away from the camera than the shooter."
1127-2,"No, the target basket is located in front of the man. While the man is facing away from the camera in the third segment, he is facing towards the smaller, distant basket which is his target, and he throws the ball in that direction."
1127-3,"No, the target basket is not positioned directly in front of the ball shooter.

**Explanation:** In the third segment (0:07-0:10), the shooter is facing the general direction where two hoops are visible. However, the specific hoop he targets and successfully shoots into is positioned noticeably to his left, not straight ahead from his perspective."
1127-7,C
1130-0,"**Blue and Green:** Both the blue and green balls are attached to the table. When the man swings his arm and hits the table, the vibration travels through the table to the stands holding the blue and green balls, causing them both to swing significantly. The red ball is attached to the whiteboard behind and is largely unaffected by the table impact."
1130-1,"The red ball showed the most movement when the old man swung his arm widely.

*   **Explanation:** The video shows three suspended balls: blue, green, and red, from left to right. When the older man makes a wide, sweeping gesture with his arm towards the right, the red ball on the far right swings significantly higher and with much greater amplitude compared to the blue and green balls, which exhibit minimal movement."
1130-2,"**No, the red ball did not move significantly.** When the older man swung his arm with the largest magnitude, the red ball remained relatively stationary, showing no noticeable swing or displacement."
1130-3,"No, it was not the blue ball that moved significantly when the old man swung his arm with the largest magnitude.

**Explanation:** During the video, the old man makes several movements with his right arm. The largest arm movement coincides with the *red* ball being launched significantly higher than before. The blue and green balls remain relatively stationary throughout, showing only minor vibrations."
1130-7,A
1134-0,"Upon release, the ball traveled in an arc, hit the backboard, rebounded, and then appeared to pass sideways through the mesh of the net before falling down through the hoop."
1134-1,"**Answer:** The ball traveled in an upward arc towards the basketball hoop, but was slightly too high.

**Explanation:** Upon release, the ball followed a curved, parabolic path moving forwards and upwards from the shooter's hands. The trajectory was aimed at the hoop but carried the ball slightly too high, causing it to go over the rim and hit the backboard above the hoop."
1134-2,"No, the ball did not bounce back to the person after hitting the ring of the hoop in the first throw of the last scene.

**Explanation:** In the last scene (starting around 0:11), the person throws the ball. It hits the front of the rim and then bounces off to the left (from the viewer's perspective) and away from the person, not back towards him."
1134-3,"No, the ball of the first throw in the last scene did not descend directly towards the basketball hoop.

**Explanation:** The man threw the ball upwards. As it descended, it was heading away from the hoop's initial position. The man then physically moved the entire portable hoop into the path of the falling ball, causing it to go through the net. The hoop was moved to meet the ball, rather than the ball descending directly towards the hoop."
1134-7,B
1137-0,"When the woman is upside down (around the 0:03 mark), the man in white is standing upright, holding her. His head is facing forwards and slightly downwards, looking towards the woman and child he is supporting.

However, if the question implicitly refers to the moment the *man* is upside down (around the 0:04-0:05 mark), then his head is facing **downwards towards the ground**.

Explanation: At the end of the sequence shown, the man is flipped into an upside-down position, supported by the woman. In this inverted state, his head is oriented directly towards the grass below him."
1137-1,"The man in white is looking **upwards**.

**Explanation:** As he lifts and holds the woman in an upside-down position, his head is tilted back, and his eyes are directed towards her feet/legs, which are the highest point he is supporting."
1137-2,"**No**, when the woman is bent over (upside down), the man she is lifting is also flipped into an upside-down position. Therefore, his head is facing downwards towards the ground, not up and forward at the camera."
1137-3,"Yes, when the woman is upside down (bent over at the waist), the man's head is also facing downward. This is because he performs a handstand, balancing on her back, which requires him to be inverted with his head pointing towards the ground."
1137-7,D
1145-0,"12 hours passed between the woman looking at her phone twice as an adult.

The first time she checks her phone in the adult segment, the time displayed is 8:00. The second time she checks it, the time displayed is 20:00 (which is 8:00 PM in 24-hour format). The difference between 8:00 and 20:00 is 12 hours."
1145-1,"The time gap is 12 hours.

**Explanation:** When the woman checks her phone as an adult, the first time shown is 8:00. The second time she checks it, the time shown is 20:00. The difference between 8:00 and 20:00 is 12 hours."
1145-2,"Yes, the woman checks her phone 12 hours apart as an adult. In the video segment depicting adulthood, she first checks her phone when it displays 8:00, and the next time she checks it, the time shown is 20:00 (8:00 PM), which is exactly 12 hours later."
1145-3,"**No**, the woman does not check her phone twice within a minute as an adult.

*   **Explanation:** In the ""adult"" part of the video, the first time she checks her phone, the screen shows 8:00. The second time she checks it, the screen shows 20:00 (which is 8:00 PM). This indicates a 12-hour gap between the two checks, not one minute."
1145-7,D
1159-0,"The fifth item shown in the video is **Highlighters**. This is indicated by the text ""Highlighters"" appearing over an image of several Stabilo Boss highlighters.

The seventh item shown in the video is **Eraser**. This is indicated by the text ""Eraser"" appearing over an image of four block erasers."
1159-1,"**Fifth Item: Highlighters** - The video displays a set of Stabilo Boss highlighters in various pastel colors as the fifth item in the sequence.
**Seventh Item: Eraser** - Following the measurement scale (ruler), the video shows four block erasers in pastel-colored holders as the seventh item."
1159-2,"Yes, the fifth item shown in the video is a set of highlighters, and the seventh item shown is a set of erasers."
1159-3,"No, the fifth item shown in the video is highlighters, and the seventh item is an eraser."
1159-7,A
1160-0,"The fourth item shown in the video is a **chunky, heavy, black metal fidget slider**.

It appears at the 0:15 mark, following the MT-01 toy. The narrator describes it as ""just a chunky and heavy piece of metal that catches the most attention."" The video shows it being manipulated as a two-piece magnetic slider, producing distinct clicking sounds."
1160-1,"The fourth toy displayed is a chunky and heavy black metal slider.

**Explanation:** It appears in the video sequence after the MT-01 multi-function toy and is described by the narrator as a ""chunky and heavy piece of metal that catches the most attention."""
1160-2,"Yes, the fourth item in the video is a metal fidget toy that resembles a mahjong tile.

**Explanation:** The video displays five fidget toys sequentially. The fourth item, shown around the 0:15 mark, is a rectangular, black, metal slider described as ""chunky and heavy"". Its block-like shape and engraved surface bear a resemblance to the general form factor of a mahjong tile, even though the material and specific design are different."
1160-3,"No, the fourth item in the video is not a small black pill-shaped fidget toy. The fourth item shown is described as a ""chunky and heavy piece of metal"" and is visibly rectangular with an engraved design. The small black pill-shaped fidget toy is actually the second item presented in the video."
1160-7,C
1161-0,"The color order displayed by the long strip of light is Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Red, and finally Orange/Amber. This sequence is observed as the light cycles through these different colors in the video."
1161-1,"The sequence of colors shown by the long strip of light on the object is: **Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Red, Orange.**

**Explanation:** The video shows the light strip initially off. When activated, it first illuminates yellow, then sequentially changes to green, blue, purple, red, and finally orange before the clip ends."
1161-2,"No, the long strip of light does not display the colors in the exact order requested.

**Explanation:** The light strip cycles through yellow, green, cyan, purple, red, and orange. It skips the color blue between cyan and purple compared to the sequence mentioned in the question."
1161-3,"Yes, the color order displayed by the long strip of light on the object in the video is yellow, green, blue, purple, and red.

**Explanation:** The video shows the light strip illuminating sequentially, starting with yellow, then transitioning to green, followed by blue, then purple, and finally red, before changing to an orange/amber color."
1161-7,A
1162-0,"Based on the video, the order of the menu options browsed is:

1.  **Calendar**: This is the first option highlighted when the menu is accessed.
2.  **Clock**: The user scrolls down, highlighting this option next.
3.  **Notes**: Scrolling down again highlights this option.
4.  **Calculator**: This is the fourth option highlighted in the sequence.
5.  **Settings**: This is the last option shown being highlighted as the user scrolls down.

**Explanation:** The video shows the user pressing the down navigation button repeatedly, causing the highlight to move sequentially through these five menu options in the order listed above."
1162-1,"The sequence of menu options the person navigates through is: **Calendar -> Clock -> Notes -> Calculator -> Settings**.

**Explanation:** After accessing the main menu, the highlight starts on ""Calendar"". The user then presses the down navigation button four times, causing the highlight to move sequentially down the list, passing over ""Clock"", ""Notes"", and ""Calculator"", before finally resting on ""Settings""."
1162-2,"Yes, the person browses through the menu options starting with Calendar and ending with Calculator. The video shows the user navigating downwards through the menu list, highlighting 'Calendar' first, then 'Clock', then 'Notes', and finally stopping on 'Calculator'."
1162-3,"Yes, the person browses through the menu options including Settings.

**Explanation:** Around the 0:05 mark in the video, the person scrolls down through the main menu. The options displayed in sequence are Calendar, Clock, Notes, Calculator, and Settings, before the selection stops on Calculator."
1162-7,B
1168-0,"The man in the red hat did not fall into a real hole. He pretended to fall into a 3D chalk art illusion painted on the flat ground. He was interacting playfully with the artwork, likely while posing for a photo requested by the woman next to him."
1168-1,"The man in the red hat did not fall into a real hole; he pretended to fall into a 3D chalk art illusion painted on the flat ground.

**Explanation:** The video shows an artist creating 3D artwork designed to look like a deep chasm. The man stepped onto the painted area, likely to pose for a photo as requested by the woman with him, and acted out falling into the illusion for effect. The ground is solid and flat, and his 'fall' was a deliberate interaction with the optical illusion."
1168-2,"Yes, the man in the red hat appeared to fall into the hole due to a combination of video editing and an optical illusion.

**Explanation:** The drawing on the ground is a 3D optical illusion designed to look like a deep hole from a specific angle. However, it is drawn on a flat, solid surface. The man's disappearance into the 'hole' is not physically possible and is accomplished through video editing techniques timed to his movement onto the illusion. This is confirmed when the woman subsequently steps onto the exact same area without falling, showing the ground is solid."
1168-3,"Yes, the man in the red hat appears to fall into the hole, seemingly deceived by the realistic 3D street painting.

**Explanation:** The video shows a 3D street painting designed to look like a deep chasm. The man in the red hat walks towards it, and when asked to pose for a photo, he steps onto the edge of the painted chasm and appears to fall in. While the ""fall"" itself is likely a visual effect or a staged stunt (as one cannot fall through paint on a flat surface), within the narrative presented by the video, the character acts as if he was deceived by the illusion and fell into the depicted hole."
1168-7,C
1169-0,"The guy in the black and white clothes wasn't actually kicked to pieces by the football.

**Explanation:** This was a visual trick or a staged stunt. The person in the referee outfit likely moved out of the way very quickly at the moment the ball was kicked, while pre-placed clothes and extra footballs were simultaneously revealed or dropped to create the illusion of him disintegrating upon impact. It's a common type of performance illusion designed for entertainment."
1169-1,"The effect of the man in the black and white clothes appearing to shatter was created using **video editing**.

*   **Explanation:** At the moment the soccer ball reaches the man, the video likely cuts or uses digital effects (VFX) to remove the man from the frame instantly. Simultaneously, footage or a digital composite showing his clothes and several soccer balls falling to the ground is inserted, creating the seamless illusion that he disintegrated upon impact. The original person then reappears from behind the falling items, having been hidden or moved out of frame during the edit."
1169-2,"**Yes**, the man appearing to be kicked into pieces (his clothing and multiple soccer balls) is a visual effect achieved through video editing. It is physically impossible for a person to disintegrate in this manner upon being hit by a soccer ball, indicating that the scene was manipulated in post-production to create a humorous or surprising visual gag."
1169-3,"No, the man in the black and white clothes was not kicked to pieces because he was a mannequin.

The figure that was hit by the soccer ball was a prop, likely consisting of the referee's clothes (shirt, pants, hat, shoes) stuffed with multiple soccer balls. This was a planned trick shot or illusion, where the prop was designed to disintegrate upon impact, revealing the clothes and extra balls, while the actual person was unharmed."
1169-7,B
1170-0,"The containers disappeared due to **video editing and visual effects (VFX)**.

The instantaneous vanishing of multiple large, heavy shipping containers as depicted is physically impossible. This effect was created digitally in post-production by manipulating the video footage, likely using software to erase the containers from the scene after the man makes the gesture."
1170-1,"The containers vanished due to **video editing or special effects (VFX)**.

**Explanation:** The disappearance of the containers is instantaneous, clean, and defies the laws of physics (they don't fall or get lifted away realistically). This indicates the effect was created digitally in post-production by altering the video footage."
1170-2,"Yes, the containers disappeared because the video uses post-production visual effects to simulate a game of Tetris. The vanishing of completed rows is a characteristic feature of the game and is not something that happens with real shipping containers."
1170-3,"**No**, the containers disappeared due to visual effects or video editing. While the video *depicts* the stack becoming unstable and collapsing, the containers vanish instantly and completely in a way that is not physically realistic, indicating it's a special effect designed to simulate the consequence of the instability, likely mimicking a game like Tetris ending."
1170-7,C
1173-0,"The person in the back seat disappeared due to video editing. The video likely uses a cut, hidden by the chaotic splash of the drinks, to transition from a shot showing the person being splashed to a subsequent shot where the person has been removed from the car, leaving only the mess behind. This is a common editing technique used to create a comedic or surprising effect."
1173-1,"The person vanished due to **video editing**.

**Explanation:** The sudden disappearance happens precisely when the drinks spill and create visual chaos. This indicates a cut or edit in the video footage. The scene was likely filmed up to the point of the spill with the person present, and then a separate shot of the messy aftermath without the person was edited in, using the splash to mask the transition."
1173-2,"Yes. The person is shown being splashed by the drinks, and in the very next shot, which shows the aftermath of the spill, the person is instantly gone. This abrupt removal without any depiction of them leaving the car indicates that they were removed from the scene using post-production editing, likely through a simple cut between filming the splash and filming the empty, messy seat."
1173-3,"No. The passenger explicitly warns the driver about an upcoming bump, and the car then jolts, causing the drinks to spill. The person's disappearance immediately after the spill is a result of video editing for comedic effect, not a physical consequence of the car making a sudden stop or sharp turn."
1173-7,D
1175-0,"The bear's movement is created using **video editing and visual effects (VFX), likely involving Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI)**.

**Explanation:** The video starts with an artist appearing to draw on the pavement. The transition from the flat drawing to a fully animated, 3D-looking polar bear that moves and interacts is not physically possible in real-time on the street. This effect is achieved in post-production by digitally adding an animated CGI bear into the live-action footage, seamlessly replacing or overlaying the original chalk drawing area when the ""transformation"" occurs."
1175-1,"The technique used is **Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI)**, a type of **Visual Effects (VFX)**.

**Explanation:** The moving polar bear is not real; it's a digital creation. A 3D model of the bear was animated using computer software and then digitally added (composited) into the live-action video footage of the street scene during post-production. This allows the flat chalk drawing to seemingly transform into a realistic, moving animal that interacts with the environment and people."
1175-2,"Yes, the bear on the ground is made to appear to move through clever editing or visual effects.

The video initially shows an artist working on what appears to be a static 3D chalk painting of a bear on the pavement. When the woman prepares to take a photo and says ""Say cheese,"" the static image is seamlessly replaced with footage of a moving bear (which could be real or CGI) that interacts with the scene, indicating a transition achieved through post-production editing rather than the painting itself animating."
1175-3,"No, the bear on the ground is not a mechanical bear moving.

Its appearance directly from the flat chalk drawing on the pavement indicates that it is a visual effect, likely computer-generated imagery (CGI), added to the video in post-production, rather than a physical mechanical object present during filming."
1175-7,B
1176-0,"The plant appeared to grow larger due to video editing and special effects.

The video cuts from a scene where the man holds a small potted plant outside a small greenhouse to a completely different scene inside a much larger, lush environment (likely a different location or set) featuring a giant plant prop or CGI effect. The transition isn't shown; the cut creates the illusion that the small plant instantly became massive upon entering the greenhouse."
1176-1,"The plant in the man's hand did not actually grow larger. The apparent change in size is due to **video editing and a scene change**.

The video cuts from a scene where the man is holding a small plant prop outside a small greenhouse to a completely different scene inside a much larger environment (likely a different location or set) where a separate, giant plant prop is revealed. It's a visual trick using editing to switch between two different-sized props in different settings."
1176-2,"Yes, the plant in the man's hand appeared larger due to a visual effect created by post-production video editing techniques. The transition from the small plant held outside the greenhouse to the enormous plant inside happens almost instantly and results in a size change that is physically impossible for a real plant, indicating the use of editing or special effects like scaling or CGI."
1176-3,"No, the plant did not grow larger because of a change in perspective. The apparent growth is a visual effect created through video editing. As the man passes through the doorway, the video cuts from a scene with him holding a small plant to a different scene featuring a giant prop plant in a much larger environment."
1176-7,B
1177-0,"The man suddenly appeared on the other boat through video editing.

**Explanation:** The video uses a technique called a jump cut. The footage cuts from the moment the man jumps into the water near the pier directly to a separate shot where he is already standing on the boat further away. The editing removes the time and action it would have taken for him to actually swim to the boat and climb aboard, creating the illusion of an instantaneous transition. The man himself hints at this before jumping by saying, ""No, it's like, it's edited."""
1177-1,"The technique used is **Video Editing**, specifically a **Jump Cut**.

**Explanation:** The video seamlessly cuts from the shot where the man jumps into the water behind the towel to a separate, pre-recorded shot of him already standing on the boat further away. The towel dropping and the splash in the water act as visual cover, hiding the edit point and making the transition appear instantaneous."
1177-2,"Yes, the man's appearance on the boat is due to video editing and visual effects.

The transition from him jumping off the dock into the water to instantly appearing standing on the boat further away is physically impossible to achieve in real-time. This type of seamless, instantaneous change of location is a hallmark of clever video editing, often involving cutting between different takes or using visual effects to merge separate shots."
1177-3,"**No**, the man did not swim to the other boat as depicted in the immediate transition.

**Explanation:** The man uses the towel as a distraction before jumping into the water from the pier. However, he appears on the boat almost instantaneously after hitting the water. This rapid change in location strongly indicates that video editing was used to create an illusion, rather than him actually swimming the distance in that short moment."
1177-7,B
1178-0,"The laptop appears in the final scene because the time warp scan filter (the moving blue line) distorts the image of the smartphone. As the filter scans across the phone, the person bends the phone upwards, causing the filter to capture the top and bottom halves at an angle relative to each other. This specific interaction between the phone's movement and the filter's sequential image capture creates the visual illusion of the smartphone being folded open like a laptop."
1178-1,"The appearance of a laptop is a visual effect created by using a time warp scan filter. As the filter's scan line moves across the smartphone, the person folds the device, causing the filter to capture the phone in a bent state, which distorts the final image to resemble an open laptop."
1178-2,"Yes, the laptop shown in the final scene is the smartphone transformed by a visual effect filter.

The video utilizes a ""time warp scan"" filter, recognizable by the moving vertical cyan line. This filter captures the image line by line, and any movement of the object (the phone) relative to the scan line causes distortion. In the final scene, the phone is manipulated as the scan line passes over it, creating the distorted shape that resembles an open laptop purely through this visual effect. The physical object remains a smartphone throughout the process."
1178-3,"**No**, the ""laptop"" shown in the final scene is not an actual foldable device that unfolds from the smartphone.

**Explanation:** The video uses a visual effect known as the ""Time Warp Scan"" filter. This filter scans the image along a line, and as the person moves the standard, rigid smartphone while the scan line passes over it, the filter distorts the phone's image, creating the illusion that it is folding or changing shape into a tablet or laptop. The phone itself does not physically fold."
1178-7,A
1181-0,"The Colosseum didn't actually disappear. The man created an optical illusion by holding up an empty picture frame and perfectly aligning it with the real Colosseum in the background. When he ran away holding the frame, the view of the Colosseum seen *through* the frame moved along with him, creating the visual trick that the building itself had been taken or had vanished."
1181-1,"The technique used is **Substitution with a Photograph/Image using a Prop Frame**.

**Explanation:** The man first holds up an empty frame, carefully aligning it so the real Colosseum is perfectly visible within its borders from the camera's perspective. He then quickly places the frame onto the easel. Attached to the back of this frame (or the canvas placed within it) is a photograph or print of the Colosseum. When placed on the easel, this photograph physically blocks the view of the real Colosseum and replaces it with the image, creating the illusion that the view has been instantly captured or painted."
1181-2,"**No**, the Colosseum did not disappear due to post-production effects. The video employs a simple visual trick where the artist holds up an empty frame, aligning it perfectly with the actual Colosseum in the background. This creates the illusion of the Colosseum being captured within the frame, but the real structure remains visible throughout the scene."
1181-3,"**Answer:** No, the Colosseum did not disappear because of a painting held in front of it.

**Explanation:** The man initially had a rudimentary painting on a canvas. He then wiped the canvas off, revealing it was just an empty frame. He held this empty frame up, and the real Colosseum was perfectly visible *through* the frame, creating an optical illusion that looked like a realistic painting within the frame. The Colosseum itself never disappeared."
1181-7,A
1182-0,"The ladder appears through video editing. The man throws a small, miniature ladder upwards towards the cloud, and then visual effects are used to instantly replace it with the full-sized ladder standing beneath the cloud."
1182-1,"The ladder appears instantly after the man throws a small, blue, foldable object towards the ground under the cloud. Through a visual effect or editing trick, the small object is replaced by the full-sized ladder the moment it lands."
1182-2,"Yes, the ladder beneath the clouds is made to look full-sized through video editing techniques.

In the video, the man initially holds a small, toy-sized ladder. He throws this small ladder upwards, and in the next moment, a full-sized ladder is seen standing on the ground. This instantaneous change in size and position is not physically possible and is achieved through video editing, likely using a cut or visual effect to replace the small prop with the large one."
1182-3,"No, the ladder does not turn into a smaller size as it moves toward the clouds. Instead, the video shows the man holding a small, miniature ladder and throwing it upwards; through a visual effect, it transforms into a full-sized ladder as it approaches the cloud."
1182-7,C
1183-0,"The sky suddenly darkened because of a video edit or special effect. This edit was timed to coincide with the man reaching for the sun, creating the visual illusion that he ""grabbed"" the sun out of the sky, thereby turning day into night and transforming the sun into the glowing orb he holds."
1183-1,"The sky became dark because the man in the video appeared to reach out and ""catch"" the sun from the sky. The video visually implies that his action removed the primary light source, turning it into the glowing orb he holds, thus causing the instant transition from day to night outside his window."
1183-2,"Yes, the sky appears to darken due to a combination of lighting changes and post-production effects.

**Explanation:** The transition from bright daylight outside the window to complete darkness is instantaneous when the man ""grabs"" the sun. This abrupt change isn't natural and strongly indicates a cut or transition effect added in post-production. Additionally, the lighting within the room shifts dramatically from bright to dark, which would involve changing the physical lighting setup between shots or significant exposure adjustments, further supporting the combination of practical lighting changes and digital editing/effects to achieve the desired outcome."
1183-3,"**No**, the sky darkened because the person in the video appeared to magically capture the sun, transforming it into a glowing orb. This action caused the scene outside the window, including the sky, to instantly turn dark, indicating a fantastical removal of the sun as the light source, not the turning off of lights within the room."

1192-0,"A standing sprinkler suddenly appeared because the man participating in the water fight threw a device from the orange gauntlet on his arm. This device, which he mentions is inspired by the ""Ratchet & Clank"" video game (specifically resembling the Topiary Sprinkler weapon), deployed into a functioning sprinkler upon hitting the ground as part of the game."
1192-1,"The sudden appearance of the standing sprinkler was caused by the man firing the large orange and grey toy weapon he was holding.

**Explanation:** In the context of the video, the man explicitly references the ""Ratchet & Clank"" video game. The toy weapon is meant to represent the ""Topiary Sprinkler"" from that game, which functions by creating sprinklers that turn targets into topiaries (as seen later in the clip). While achieved through visual effects in reality, the *in-video* cause is the activation of this specific toy weapon."
1192-2,"Yes, the standing sprinkler's sudden appearance was likely due to creative video editing.

**Explanation:** The orange gauntlet-like object is thrown towards the ground. In the very next moment, the sprinkler is instantly standing upright and spraying water. There is no visible transition or action showing it being placed or popping up; it simply materializes, which is a common technique in video editing to create surprising or magical effects."
1192-3,"No, the standing sprinkler did not appear because it was hidden underground and activated by the ball.

**Explanation:**

The sudden appearance of the topiary-shaped sprinkler is achieved through visual effects (VFX) or augmented reality (AR). The person firing the weapon mentions it's from the ""Ratchet & Clank"" video game, where a weapon called the ""Topiary Sprinkler"" transforms targets into decorative, water-spraying shrubs. The video simulates this game mechanic digitally; it's not a real physical sprinkler emerging from the ground."

1203-0,"The man took the towel out without touching the stream by twisting it upwards around the neck of the faucet.

**Explanation:** Instead of pulling the towel straight down through the water stream (like the woman did), he grabbed the sides of the towel and rotated it upwards. This twisting motion lifted the towel above the spout where the water was coming out, allowing him to remove it without his hands passing through the stream."
1203-1,"The man used an **unwinding method by pulling only one end** of the towel.

**Explanation:** Instead of pulling both ends downwards (which would drag the towel through the water stream), he grabbed a single end of the wrapped towel and pulled it outwards and slightly sideways. This action caused the towel to unspool or unwind itself from around the faucet neck, moving in a path away from the direct flow of water."
1203-2,"**Yes**, the man managed to remove the towel. He achieved this by taking the loose, open end of the towel and unwrapping it around the base of the faucet, effectively reversing how it was put on, which involved moving that end across the path of the water flow to unwind it completely."
1203-3,"**Yes**, the man used the detachable spray head of the faucet to take out the towel without touching the stream.

He wrapped the towel around the pull-down spray head and then pulled the head itself downwards through the arch of the faucet. This maneuver successfully removed the towel while keeping his hands away from the direct flow of water."

1206-0,"The blue paint is seemingly spilling unusually because **the video clip is being played in reverse.**

This editing technique creates the illusion that the paint is defying gravity and splashing upwards onto the man's face from the can. In reality, the action was likely filmed with the paint already splashed, and the footage was then reversed to show it appearing to fly back towards the can and onto the person."
1206-1,"The blue paint appears to spill in an unusual upward direction because **the video clip is played in reverse.**

**Explanation:** The creator likely filmed the paint falling *off* their face (moving downwards due to gravity) and then reversed that section of the video during editing. This playback reversal creates the illusion that the paint is splashing upwards onto the face, seemingly defying gravity."
1206-2,"No, the blue paint is not spilling upwards because the set is upside down.

If the set were upside down, gravity would pull the paint towards the actual floor (appearing as the ceiling in the video frame). When the man tilts the can towards his face (which would be downwards in an upside-down orientation), the paint would fall away from him, not splash onto his face. The effect seen is almost certainly achieved by filming the paint falling *off* his face into the can and then playing the footage in reverse."
1206-3,"No, the blue paint spilling is not unusual; it is the expected and direct result of gravity acting on the liquid paint when the can is held upside down above the person's head."
1206-7,C
1209-0,"The woman's speed in the photo at the end of the video is **zero**.

**Explanation:** The image shown is a still photograph, which captures a single, frozen moment in time. Speed requires movement over a duration of time (distance/time), and since a photograph represents only an instant with no time duration, the concept of speed does not apply to the subject depicted *within* the static image itself. While the photo captures an action that involved movement (stepping into the puddle), the woman herself is motionless within the frame of the final picture."
1209-1,"The speed of the woman in the final image of the video is **zero**.

**Explanation:** The final image is a still photograph, which captures a single, frozen moment in time. Speed is a measure of distance traveled over a period of time. Since a static photograph represents an instant with no duration, there is no movement occurring *within* the image itself, and therefore, the speed is zero."
1209-2,"**Yes**, the appearance of fast movement is largely an illusion created by the photo composition and technique.

The photograph uses a fast shutter speed to freeze the exact moment the foot hits the puddle, capturing the water splashing and the added leaves suspended mid-air. This freezing of peak action, combined with a low camera angle, makes the simple act of stepping into the water look much more dynamic and faster than it likely was in reality."
1209-3,"Yes, the woman in the photo appears to be running quickly.

**Explanation:** Her right leg is lifted high with a bent knee, and her left foot is pushing off from the puddle, creating a large, dynamic splash. This pose is characteristic of a running stride, and the significant water displacement indicates a forceful and rapid movement. The frozen motion of the water droplets and leaves further emphasizes the speed of the action captured in the photograph."
1209-7,C
1210-0,"The focus of the video shooting shifts from the woman viewing the photograph to the photograph itself.

**Explanation:** Initially, the shot includes the woman in the foreground looking at the artwork, sharing the focus. The camera then subtly moves (appearing to zoom out slightly or pan left), which de-emphasizes the woman and brings the framed photograph into a more central and prominent position, making it the primary subject of the shot."
1210-1,"The focus remains consistently sharp on the photograph hanging on the wall throughout the video. However, the compositional emphasis changes: it starts with the woman in the foreground (slightly out of focus) looking at the photo, and then the camera moves slightly, making the photograph the more central and dominant subject in the frame."
1210-2,"No, the focus does not remain solely on the photograph throughout the sequence.

Explanation: While the video begins focused primarily on the photograph, the camera slowly zooms out, bringing the person viewing the artwork and the surrounding gallery wall more prominently into the frame. This changes the composition and broadens the focus to include the context of viewing the art, rather than just the artwork itself."
1210-3,"No, the focus of the video does not shift from the background to the foreground as it progresses.

**Explanation:** The video maintains its focus on the framed photograph in the background throughout the clip. The person viewing the photograph in the foreground remains consistently out of focus."
1210-7,C
1214-0,"The motion of the shot is a **zoom out** or **pull-back**.

**Explanation:** The camera starts with a relatively close view of the woman lying on the green structure and then moves progressively farther away, widening the field of view to reveal the full spiral staircase surrounding her. This makes the woman appear smaller within the frame and emphasizes the architectural environment."
1214-1,"The camera zooms out.

It starts with a closer high-angle shot focused on the green structure and then rapidly zooms out to reveal the woman lying on it within the larger context of the spiral staircase."
1214-2,"Yes, the camera is moving closer to the woman, creating a zoom-in effect as it films her.

**Explanation:** The video begins with a view from higher up the spiral staircase, showing the woman on the green padded area below. As the video continues, the camera physically moves down the staircase, getting nearer to the woman. This movement makes her appear larger in the frame, producing a zoom-in effect."
1214-3,"Yes, the camera is moving away from the woman, creating a zoom-out effect.

**Explanation:** The video begins with a closer view of the woman on the green structure. As the video plays, the camera pulls back (moves upwards along the staircase), revealing more of the spiral staircase and making the woman appear smaller in the frame. This increasing field of view is characteristic of a zoom-out effect achieved by moving the camera away from the subject."
1214-7,C
1223-0,"The camera view differs in the last throw in two main ways:

1.  **Slight Zoom-In:** The camera zooms in slightly, tightening the frame around the pans and the target cup compared to the wider shot used for the earlier throws.
2.  **Downward Tilt/Pan:** The camera tilts downwards to follow the ping pong ball's final trajectory as it bounces off the last pan and goes into the cup, keeping the action centered. This tracking movement is not as evident in the previous attempts."
1223-1,"During the final throw, the camera zooms in and tilts downwards. This change provides a closer and more focused view on the pans and the cup, emphasizing the ball's trajectory and successful landing, whereas the earlier throws were filmed from a wider, more static angle showing more of the room and the person."
1223-2,"Yes, the camera zooms in on the floor during the last throw.

**Explanation:** Throughout the initial attempts shown in the video, the camera maintains a fixed, relatively wide shot, capturing the person, the couch, and the entire setup on the floor. However, during the final, successful throw, the camera noticeably moves closer and tilts downwards, focusing tightly on the floor area to capture the ball bouncing off the last pan and landing in the cup. This close-up view contrasts with the preceding stationary shots."
1223-3,"No, the camera angle does not keep the same angle as before.

**Explanation:**
During the earlier throws, the camera maintains a consistent wide shot. However, for the final throw, the camera zooms in slightly and tilts downwards, focusing more closely on the pans, the ball, and the target cup."
1223-7,D
1225-0,"The short friend is mainly visible when the first camera zoom is complete. He is centered in the frame after entering the doorway, and his surprised facial expression is the focus of the shot."
1225-1,"The shorter man is prominently seen when the camera finishes zooming in for the first time. He is positioned centrally in the frame, and his surprised facial expression is the main focus."
1225-2,"Yes, the person mainly visible after the first camera zoom is a man in a gray Under Armour t-shirt.

**Explanation:** After the taller individual moves further into the room, the camera focuses on the shorter man who has just entered. He is wearing a gray t-shirt, and the Under Armour logo is visible on the front."
1225-3,"No, the person mainly visible after the first camera zoom is not a woman in a red dress. The person is a man with dwarfism, identified as the ""short friend"" in the video's text, and he is wearing a grey t-shirt and black shorts. The camera focuses on his surprised reaction upon entering the house."
1225-7,C
1229-0,"The object in front of the mirror (a pawn) is different from its reflection (a king) because the scene is staged. The video shows someone swapping the king, which was initially in front of the mirror, with the pawn just before the final shot is composed. The mirror is reflecting the king, which is likely positioned strategically out of the direct line of sight but at the correct angle to be reflected into the camera, creating an optical illusion."
1229-1,"The discrepancy is caused by **physical manipulation of the objects during a sequential camera capture**.

**Explanation:** The phone used a capture mode (like panorama or a similar sweep function, as indicated by the on-screen guide) that records the image sequentially over time as the phone moves. The reflection of the king was captured first. Then, as shown briefly in the setup, the king piece was physically swapped with the pawn piece *during* the capture process. The camera then captured the pawn in the foreground position later in the sequence. The final image stitches these different moments together, creating the illusion of the pawn reflecting as a king."
1229-2,"**No**, the difference is not directly caused by the panoramic photography feature itself altering the reflection.

**Explanation:** The panoramic feature captures the image sequentially as the phone moves. In the video, while the panoramic photo is being taken, someone physically swaps the pawn behind the mirror for a king. The phone captures the pawn early in the sweep and then captures the reflection of the king later in the sweep after the swap has occurred. The final panoramic image stitches these different moments together, creating the illusion that the pawn's reflection is a king. The feature enables the trick by capturing over time, but the cause of the difference is the manual swap of the objects."
1229-3,"**No**, the difference between the object and its reflection is not because the mirror is a special type.

**Explanation:** Mirrors reflect the object placed in front of them. While different types of mirrors (like concave or convex) can change the size or orientation of the reflection, they cannot fundamentally change the identity or shape of the object being reflected (e.g., transforming a pawn into a king). The effect shown in the video is a visual trick achieved through editing, staging (swapping the pieces), or digital manipulation, not a natural optical property of the mirror."
1229-7,C
1231-0,"The water appears to flow backwards due to an optical illusion created by filming the waterfall's reflection in a puddle and then rotating the video footage 180 degrees.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filming the Reflection:** The camera was positioned low to the ground, capturing the reflection of the man and the waterfall in a puddle. Reflections in water are naturally inverted (upside down).
2.  **Rotating the Footage:** The recorded video of the upside-down reflection was then rotated 180 degrees in editing (or by physically rotating the phone viewing it).
3.  **The Illusion:** This rotation makes the reflected man appear upright relative to the frame. However, it also flips the perceived direction of the water flow. The water flowing *down* in the inverted reflection appears to flow *up* (backwards) after the 180-degree rotation."
1231-1,"The waterfall appears to flow in reverse because the video captures the **reflection** of the scene in a puddle of water and then presents this footage **rotated 180 degrees**.

*   **Explanation:** Filming the reflection naturally inverts the image vertically (top becomes bottom). When this vertically inverted footage is then rotated 180 degrees, the ground appears at the top of the frame and the sky/top of the waterfall appears at the bottom. Consequently, the actual downward flow of the water, having been inverted by the reflection, appears to move upwards in the final rotated view."
1231-2,"Yes, the backward flow of the waterfall at the end of the video is due to reverse video processing.

**Explanation:**

Water naturally flows downwards due to gravity. In the final segment of the video, the water in the waterfall is shown flowing upwards, which defies the laws of physics. This visual effect is achieved by playing the recorded footage of the waterfall in reverse, a common video editing technique."
1231-3,"No, the waterfall does not appear to flow backwards because of special effects techniques applied to the water itself.

The illusion is created by filming the reflection of the waterfall in a puddle of water on the ground. The entire video frame is then rotated 180 degrees. This rotation makes the reflection (which shows the water flowing downwards) appear at the top of the frame, creating the visual trick that the water is flowing upwards against gravity relative to the rotated landscape."
1231-7,D
1233-0,"The final photo shows two reflections because it was taken using the panoramic mode on a smartphone.

*   **Explanation:** Panoramic mode captures an image by stitching together sequential frames as the camera is moved (panned). In the video, the man is initially standing behind the woman, and his reflection is captured at the *start* of the panoramic sweep. He then walks away as the photographer continues panning the phone. The camera then captures the woman's reflection in a later part of the sweep. The final panoramic image combines these different moments in time, resulting in both the man's (standing) and the woman's (kneeling) reflections appearing in the single composite photo, even though the man was not physically present for the entire duration of the capture."
1233-1,"The final image was created using a smartphone's panorama mode, capturing the reflection in the puddle. Panorama mode works by stitching together multiple images taken sequentially as the camera moves.

Initially, both the man and the woman were present, and their reflections were captured in the first part of the panoramic sweep. The man then moved out of the frame while the camera continued its sweep. Because the woman remained still, her reflection was captured throughout. The final panoramic image combines the frames captured over time, including the man's reflection from the beginning of the process and the woman's reflection, resulting in two reflections appearing even though only the woman is physically present in the final pose."
1233-2,"Yes, the use of the panoramic camera function is the reason for the two distinct reflections appearing in the final photo.

**Explanation:**

The video demonstrates the photographer using the panoramic mode on a smartphone, held upside down, to capture the reflection in the puddle. Panoramic mode creates a wide image by stitching together multiple frames taken sequentially as the camera moves. In this case, the camera captured the reflection of the man in the initial part of the panoramic sweep. As the photographer moved the camera to continue the panorama, the man moved out of the frame, but his reflection had already been recorded. The camera then captured the reflection of the woman, who remained in place. The final panoramic image combines these sequential captures, resulting in both reflections appearing in the single photograph."
1233-3,"No, the effect is not due to image synthesis technology.

The final image is created using a photographic technique involving the smartphone's vertical panorama mode. The photographer first captures the real reflection of the subject and the sky in the puddle by pointing the phone downwards, and then tilts the phone upwards to capture the subject directly. The phone's software then stitches these captured frames together into a single panoramic image, creating the illusion seen in the final photo."

1235-0,"The answer for 4+3 = **37**.

**Explanation:**
The pattern shown in the video is to take the second number and concatenate it with the sum of the two numbers.
- 2 + 2: Second number is 2, sum is 4 -> 24
- 3 + 3: Second number is 3, sum is 6 -> 36
- 4 + 5: Second number is 5, sum is 9 -> 59
Following this pattern for 4 + 3:
- The second number is 3.
- The sum is 4 + 3 = 7.
- Concatenating the second number (3) and the sum (7) gives 37."
1235-1,"The result of 4 plus 3 according to the pattern is **37**.

**Explanation:**
The pattern observed in the examples (2+2=24, 3+3=36, 4+5=59) is that the result is formed by taking the second number as the tens digit and the sum of the two numbers as the units digit.

Applying this pattern to 4 + 3:
*   The second number is 3.
*   The sum of the two numbers (4 + 3) is 7.
*   Combining these gives the result 37."
1235-2,"Yes, based on the pattern in the video, 4 + 3 equals 37.

**Explanation:**

The pattern shown in the video is to take the second number of the addition and concatenate it with the sum of the two numbers.

*   **2 + 2 = 24:** The second number is 2, the sum is 4. Concatenated: 24.
*   **3 + 3 = 36:** The second number is 3, the sum is 6. Concatenated: 36.
*   **4 + 5 = 59:** The second number is 5, the sum is 9. Concatenated: 59.
*   **4 + 3 = ?:** Following the pattern, the second number is 3, the sum is 4 + 3 = 7. Concatenated: 37."
1235-3,"No, according to the pattern in the video, 4 + 3 does not equal 412.

**Explanation:**

The pattern observed in the video is: A + B = (B concatenated with (A+B)).

1.  **2 + 2 = 24:** Second number (2) concatenated with the sum (2+2=4) gives 24.
2.  **3 + 3 = 36:** Second number (3) concatenated with the sum (3+3=6) gives 36.
3.  **4 + 5 = 59:** Second number (5) concatenated with the sum (4+5=9) gives 59.

Applying this pattern to **4 + 3**:
*   The second number is 3.
*   The sum is 4 + 3 = 7.
*   Concatenating the second number (3) and the sum (7) gives **37**.

Therefore, based on the established pattern, 4 + 3 = 37, not 412."

1236-0,"Yes, the method is useful and produces the correct calculation result.

**Explanation:** Dividing a number ending in 0 by 5 is mathematically equivalent to first dividing the number by 10 (which is achieved by removing the trailing zero) and then multiplying the result by 2. The trick shown visually represents this valid mathematical shortcut: N0 ÷ 5 = (N × 10) ÷ 5 = N × (10 ÷ 5) = N × 2."
1236-1,"Yes, the method demonstrated effectively yields accurate calculation results for the specific problems shown.

**Explanation:** Dividing a number by 5 is mathematically equivalent to multiplying that number by 2 and then dividing by 10. For numbers ending in zero (like 10, 30, 60, 90), crossing out the zero effectively divides the number by 10. Multiplying the remaining digit by 2 completes the calculation, yielding the correct answer."
1236-2,"Yes, the method shown in the video is effective in producing accurate results for the specific division problems presented.

**Explanation:** The trick works because dividing by 5 is mathematically equivalent to multiplying by 2 and then dividing by 10. For numbers ending in zero (like 10, 30, 60, and 90), dividing by 10 is easily done by removing the zero. The method shown simplifies this: it removes the zero (effectively dividing by 10) and then multiplies the remaining digit by 2, yielding the correct answer for these specific cases (10÷5 = (10/10)*2 = 1*2 = 2; 30÷5 = (30/10)*2 = 3*2 = 6, etc.)."
1236-3,"No, the method shown in the video is not ineffective for the reason stated. The method does not involve squaring the numbers. Instead, it demonstrates a shortcut for dividing multiples of 10 by 5: remove the trailing zero (which is equivalent to dividing by 10) and then multiply the remaining digit by 2. This correctly calculates the result for the examples shown (e.g., for 90 ÷ 5, remove the 0 to get 9, then multiply 9 by 2 to get 18)."
1236-7,C
1237-0,"The answer is **63**.

**Explanation:**
The pattern in the video is not standard addition. Instead, it follows the rule `a + a = a * n`, where `n` starts at 2 for the first equation and increases by 1 for each subsequent equation:
*   4 + 4 = 4 * 2 = 08
*   5 + 5 = 5 * 3 = 15
*   6 + 6 = 6 * 4 = 24
Following this pattern, the multiplier `n` for the number 9 would be 7 (since 4 uses 2, 5 uses 3, 6 uses 4, 7 would use 5, 8 would use 6, and 9 uses 7).
Therefore, 9 + 9 = 9 * 7 = 63."
1237-1,"The result of 9 + 9 according to the pattern is 63.

**Explanation:**
The pattern observed in the equations is (Number * Number) - (Number + Number), or alternatively, Number * (Number - 2).

*   4 + 4 = (4 * 4) - (4 + 4) = 16 - 8 = 8
*   5 + 5 = (5 * 5) - (5 + 5) = 25 - 10 = 15
*   6 + 6 = (6 * 6) - (6 + 6) = 36 - 12 = 24

Applying this pattern to 9 + 9:
*   9 + 9 = (9 * 9) - (9 + 9) = 81 - 18 = 63
*   Alternatively: 9 * (9 - 2) = 9 * 7 = 63"
1237-2,"Yes, based on the pattern in the video, the equation 9 + 9 results in 63.

The pattern observed in the examples is that the result is obtained by multiplying the first number by two less than itself (a * (a-2)):
*   4 + 4 = 4 * (4-2) = 4 * 2 = 8
*   5 + 5 = 5 * (5-2) = 5 * 3 = 15
*   6 + 6 = 6 * (6-2) = 6 * 4 = 24

Applying this pattern to the final equation:
*   9 + 9 = 9 * (9-2) = 9 * 7 = 63"
1237-3,"No, according to the pattern in the video, 9 + 9 does not equal 72.

**Explanation:**
The pattern demonstrated in the video is `a + a = a * (a - 2)`.
*   4 + 4 = 4 * (4 - 2) = 4 * 2 = 08
*   5 + 5 = 5 * (5 - 2) = 5 * 3 = 15
*   6 + 6 = 6 * (6 - 2) = 6 * 4 = 24

1237-7,B
1239-0,"**No**, the method shown is not useful to produce a correct calculation result.

**Explanation:** The process starts by writing an incorrect sequence of numbers (1, 3, 5, 7...). The final, correct answers are achieved not by a mathematical calculation derived from these initial numbers, but by simply writing the correct digits next to or over the initial incorrect ones. This implies the person already knew the answers and was performing a visual trick rather than demonstrating a valid calculation technique. A useful method should allow someone to find the answer without knowing it beforehand."
1239-1,"Yes, the method shown helps in achieving accurate calculation results.

The technique involves two steps: first, writing the odd numbers sequentially from 1 to 19, and second, writing the digits from 9 down to 0 next to them. This combination accurately generates the correct products for the 19 times table from 19x1 to 19x10 (19, 38, 57, 76, 95, 114, 133, 152, 171, 190)."
1239-2,"Yes, the method is effective in producing correct results for the multiplication table of 19 from 1 to 10.

**Explanation:** The method involves two simple patterns:
1.  Write the odd numbers starting from 1 down the column for the tens (and hundreds) digits: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19.
2.  Write the digits from 9 down to 0 next to these for the units digits: 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.

Combining these two sequences correctly generates the products for 19x1 through 19x10 (19, 38, 57, 76, 95, 114, 133, 152, 171, 190), as shown in the video."
1239-3,"Yes, the method produces the correct results for the multiplication table of 19 from 1 to 10.

However, its efficiency compared to the normal method depends on the task:

1.  **For generating the entire table sequentially (19x1 to 19x10):** This pattern-based method is arguably *more efficient* because it replaces ten individual multiplication calculations with the simpler task of writing two concurrent number sequences (ascending odd numbers and descending digits 9-0).
2.  **For calculating a single product (e.g., 19 x 7):** The standard multiplication method (or a mental math trick like 20x7 - 7) is generally *more efficient* than recalling and applying the pattern up to the required point.

In summary, the trick is correct and efficient for quickly writing out the full 19 times table (1-10), but less efficient for finding individual answers or as a general multiplication strategy."

1255-1,"The color called that prompted the man to run underneath was **Yellow**.

**Explanation:** In the video, several colors (Red, Pink, Orange) are called out, but the man in the blue shirt only runs underneath the parachute immediately after the voice calls ""Yellow""."
1255-2,"**Yes**, the man ran underneath the parachute after the color yellow was called.

*   **Explanation:** The video shows the man waiting as other colors like red, pink, and orange are called. When ""Yellow"" is announced around the 0:25 mark, he immediately reacts with excitement and runs underneath the parachute."
1255-3,"**No**: The man did not run underneath when ""red"" was called.

*   **Explanation**: When ""red"" was called out (at 0:07), the video clearly shows a woman in a white top and yellow skirt running underneath the parachute. The man in the blue shirt remained in his position holding his section and only ran later when the color ""yellow"" was called (at 0:25)."

1260-0,"The man in white looks surprised because his friend (the man in black) has an immediate and intensely negative reaction after tasting the food, grabbing a napkin in apparent distress, while the man in white himself did not seem to have such a strong reaction. The surprise stems from witnessing his friend's unexpected discomfort or dislike of the food they were sharing."
1260-1,"The man in the white shirt appears ""shocked"" (represented by an edited-on troll face meme) because the man in the black shirt has a strong negative reaction after eating the food. This suggests the man in white successfully pranked the man in black, likely by giving him unexpectedly spicy or unpleasant food, and his ""shock"" is feigned surprise or amusement at the prank's success."
1260-2,"Yes, the man in white is surprised because the man in black very quickly ate all the remaining food from the shared plate they were both eating from, leaving none for the man in white who had just taken a bite himself."
1260-3,"No, the man in white does not appear surprised by the spiciness. His reaction after eating the food is calm and composed, whereas the man in black shows a strong, immediate reaction of discomfort, indicating that *he* found the food unexpectedly spicy."
1260-7,C
1261-0,"The reflection shows the two men with torches because they were part of the staged scene being photographed. The video shows the setup process, and during the actual photo capture (seen around 0:23), the men are positioned near the tree specifically to be included in the reflection from the photographer's low angle, creating a composite image within the mirror."
1261-1,"The final photograph is a composite image created using photo editing software.

The reflection showing the two men with torches was created or photographed separately and then digitally merged with the main image of the woman reading under the tree during post-processing. This technique allows photographers to combine different elements and create scenes that wouldn't be possible in a single, unedited shot, resulting in the artistic effect where the reflection shows something different from the immediate surroundings of the main subject."
1261-2,"Yes, the presence of the two men with torches in the reflection is due to the photos being intentionally shot and edited together.

The video shows the initial setup with the woman reading under the tree and papers being thrown; the mirror at this stage reflects the tree trunk and branches. It then shows a different setup being filmed for the reflection, featuring two men holding torches and smoke, which is clearly distinct from the initial scene. The final image is a composite combining the woman reading (top) with the separately shot reflection of the men with torches (bottom)."
1261-3,"Yes, the reflection of the two men holding torches is created by using a mirror placed flat on the ground. The video shows the setup where the mirror is positioned on the dirt under the tree, and the photographer captures both the scene above (a person reading) and the reflection in the mirror below, which includes the two men with torches."

1262-0,"The girl appears scared and distressed. Her intense crying immediately after touching the performer's arm suggests she was startled or frightened, possibly by realizing the ""statue"" was a real person or by thinking she had somehow ""broken"" him as the text overlay implies."
1262-1,"The girl in the pink top felt upset and distressed after grabbing the performer's arm.

This is evident because she immediately started crying loudly and looked distressed right after pulling on the performer's arm, calling out for her father."
1262-2,"Yes, the girl in the pink top felt worried and scared after she held the performer's arm.

*   **Explanation:** After touching the performer's arm, the performer makes a slight movement. The girl immediately recoils, her eyes widen, and she starts crying loudly, showing clear signs of being startled, scared, and worried by the unexpected movement of what she likely thought was an inanimate statue."
1262-3,"No, the girl in the pink top did not feel curious and amused after she held the performer's arm.

*   **Explanation:** While she initially approached the performer out of curiosity, her immediate reaction after touching his arm was to become startled and cry loudly, indicating she felt scared or distressed, not amused."
1262-7,A
1275-0,"The person in the red shirt wins the challenge. They were the last participant to successfully add water to the glass without causing it to spill; the player after them (in the blue shirt) caused the water to overflow, thus losing the challenge."
1275-1,"**The man in the blue shirt is the winner.**

He was the last participant to successfully add water to the glass without causing it to spill. The person who took the turn after him (the man in the purple shirt) caused the water to overflow, thus losing the challenge and making the man in the blue shirt the winner."
1275-2,"Yes, the person in the blue T-shirt lost the challenge while the others won.

**Explanation:** The challenge involved carefully adding water to a full glass without causing it to spill over the rim. Each participant took turns adding water. The person wearing the blue T-shirt was the one whose addition of water finally broke the surface tension, causing the water to overflow. Since the objective was to avoid spilling the water, the person who caused the spill lost the challenge."
1275-3,"**No**, the person in the blue shirt did not win the challenge. They lost because they were the one who added the final drops of water that broke the surface tension, causing the water to spill over the rim of the glass."
1275-7,A
1276-0,"The lemon icons at the top of the video represent the stages or levels of the lemon candy eating challenge.

*   **Explanation:** As each person in the video eats a progressively larger lemon-shaped candy, a green checkmark appears over one of the lemon icons, starting from the left. This visually tracks the progress through the different stages of the challenge, indicating how many levels have been successfully completed."
1276-1,"The lemon icons displayed at the top of the video serve as a visual progress tracker for the eating challenge.

**Explanation:** Each icon represents a stage or participant in the challenge involving eating lemon-shaped candy. As each person completes their turn (eating the candy), a green checkmark appears over the corresponding icon, indicating progression through the challenge and reinforcing the central lemon theme."
1276-2,"Yes, the lemon icons at the top of the video represent the different sizes of lemon candies that the participants are challenged with.

**Explanation:**
The video features four individuals, each consuming a lemon-shaped candy that increases in size with each participant. Above them, four lemon slice icons are displayed, mirroring this increase in size from left to right. As each person finishes eating their respective candy, a green checkmark appears over the icon that corresponds to the size they just consumed, visually tracking the challenge's progression through the escalating sizes."
1276-3,"No, the lemon icons at the top of the video do not indicate the level of sourness. They represent the progression through the stages of the challenge, where each stage involves eating a progressively larger piece of lemon-flavored candy. A checkmark appears over an icon as each participant completes their turn with their respective size of candy."
1276-7,D
1278-0,"The exact numerical difference in the number of attempts between the first two challenges cannot be determined from the video.

*   **Explanation:** The first challenge overlay indicates the time spent (""16 hours""), not the specific number of attempts. The second challenge overlay explicitly states it was achieved on the ""First try"" (1 attempt). Since the number of attempts for the first challenge is unknown, the difference cannot be calculated."
1278-1,"The difference in the number of attempts between the first two challenges cannot be determined from the information provided in the video.

**Explanation:**

*   The first challenge (unplugging the phone) has an overlay stating ""16 hours,"" which indicates the *time* spent practicing or attempting the trick, not the specific *number* of attempts made during that time.
*   The second challenge (knocking the bottle into the bucket) has an overlay stating ""First try,"" which clearly indicates it took exactly 1 attempt.

Since the number of attempts for the first challenge is unknown, it's impossible to calculate the numerical difference between the attempts of the two challenges."
1278-2,"No, the difference in the number of attempts between the first two challenges is not just one. The second challenge shown in the video was completed on the ""First try"" (1 attempt), while the first challenge is labeled ""16 hours"", indicating it took a significant amount of time and likely many attempts to achieve successfully, far more than 2 attempts. Therefore, the difference in attempts is much greater than one."
1278-3,"Yes.

**Explanation:** The second challenge shown was completed on the ""First try,"" meaning it took 1 attempt. The first challenge took ""16 hours."" While the exact number of attempts for the first challenge isn't stated, spending 16 hours strongly implies that it required significantly more than 3 attempts. Therefore, the difference in attempts between the first challenge (many attempts) and the second challenge (1 attempt) is more than two."

1283-0,The kid in the red uniform with the number 237 on his bib runs the fastest at the end of the video. He takes a commanding lead early in the race and visibly increases the distance between himself and the other runners as they approach the curve.
1283-1,The fastest runner among the kids at the conclusion of the video is the one with bib number 237. He establishes a clear lead shortly after the start and is significantly ahead of the other runners as they round the curve towards the end of the clip.
1283-2,"Yes, the child in the red outfit in the middle lane is the fastest at the end of the video. He takes the lead early in the race and is significantly ahead of the other runners when the video clip concludes."
1283-3,"No, the child in the green outfit is not the fastest runner at the end of the video. The video shows several children in red outfits running ahead of the child in green as the race progresses towards the end."
1283-7,C
1288-0,"The blond man appears **sheepish** or **embarrassed** at the end of the video.

**Explanation:** After playfully tapping the woman on the back with a stick hidden by a towel while she was distracted, she turns around with a startled and annoyed expression. His immediate reaction is to drop his playful pose and look towards the camera with wide eyes and a slightly tense expression, indicating he feels caught and awkward or embarrassed by her negative reaction to his prank."
1288-1,"The blond man feels **startled** and **caught** at the conclusion of the video.

**Explanation:** He is in the middle of attempting to playfully hit the woman with a stick hidden under a towel. When she unexpectedly turns around just before he can strike, he visibly flinches and his facial expression shifts to one of surprise, indicating he was startled and caught off guard in his prank attempt."
1288-2,"Yes, the blond man feels frustrated because the woman behind him revealed the trick.

His frustrated facial expression and pointing gesture occur immediately after the woman turns and shows the stick she was using to hold up the towel, spoiling the illusion he was trying to create."
1288-3,"Yes, the blond man appears playful and energetic at the end of the video.

His playfulness is shown through his dramatic, exaggerated hand gestures while holding the towel, mimicking casting a spell or performing a martial arts move, and then using the towel wrapped around a stick to playfully tap the woman. His energetic state is evident in his active posing, deliberate movements, and the focused way he performs the actions before surprising the woman."
1288-7,A
1290-0,"The man reacts with shock and surprise. This is evident as his mouth drops wide open while he looks up at the pillow, which has unexpectedly stuck to the ceiling after being thrown."
1290-1,"He reacts with shock and surprise. This is evident from his wide eyes, open mouth, and fixed stare at the pillow unexpectedly stuck to the wall."
1290-2,"Yes, the man shows signs of shock and potential pain. His eyes widen, his mouth opens wide in an exaggerated expression, and he looks down towards his hand/arm immediately after hitting the wall with the pillow, suggesting the impact was unexpectedly forceful or painful."
1290-3,"**No**, the man does not seem amused or entertained. His facial expression, characterized by wide eyes and an open mouth, clearly indicates shock and surprise that the pillow simply fell instead of sticking to the wall as it appeared to do for the woman."
1290-7,C
1293-0,"The bottle cap did not actually fly. It was suspended in the air using a thin string, held by an assistant just out of the final frame. This is a practical photography technique used to position the cap precisely for the shot, creating the illusion of it being captured mid-air. The behind-the-scenes footage clearly shows the string being used in the setup."
1293-1,"The bottle cap was made to appear to fly by suspending it from a thin string or thread.

**Explanation:** The behind-the-scenes footage clearly shows the bottle cap attached to a string, which is held to position the cap in mid-air between the camera and the subject. Water was then sprayed around it to add dynamic droplets, and the photo was taken. The thin string is difficult to see or removed in the final edited photograph, creating the illusion of levitation."
1293-2,"Yes, the bottle cap in the second scene was made to look like it was flying by using a thin string and clever camera angles.

**Explanation:** The video shows the setup where a thin string is attached to the bottle cap and held up to suspend it in the air near the model. Water is sprayed to create droplets around it. The photographer uses a low camera angle, focusing on the cap, which helps hide the string and creates the illusion of the cap flying or hovering."
1293-3,"No, the bottle cap did not fly because someone flicked it with their finger.

**Explanation:** The video shows the bottle cap suspended from a thin string or wire during the photoshoot setup. The final image creates the illusion of it flying by capturing it while hanging, along with sprayed water droplets, and likely editing out the string afterwards."
1293-7,D
1294-0,"Based on the narrative in the video, the piece of meat appeared on the grill unexpectedly while the chef's back was turned.

**Explanation:** The video first shows a man cutting meat in a hot air balloon. It then cuts to a chef grilling corn. The chef turns away momentarily, and when he looks back, a steak has suddenly appeared on the grill. His surprised reaction, including looking upwards, humorously implies within the video's narrative that the meat arrived inexplicably from an external source, possibly connecting it to the preceding scene in the sky."
1294-1,"The piece of meat was placed on the grill by someone off-camera while the chef briefly turned away, or the video was edited using a jump cut to make it appear suddenly.

**Explanation:** The chef is shown placing corn on the grill, then turns his back momentarily. When he turns back, the steak is present, and his surprised upward glance indicates he did not place it himself. The sudden appearance is most likely due to either an unseen person quickly putting the steak on the grill during that brief moment or video editing removing the frames where the steak was placed."
1294-2,"No, the piece of meat did not land on the grill because it was dropped from the hot air balloon shown.

**Explanation:** The video uses editing to create a humorous juxtaposition. The first scene shows a man cutting a large piece of cured meat in a hot air balloon. The second scene shows a different man grilling, and a raw steak suddenly appears on the grill. The types of meat are visibly different (cured vs. raw steak), and the sequence is a staged comedic effect achieved through video editing, not a depiction of a real event."
1294-3,"Based on the narrative, the answer is **no**.

**Explanation:**

The video shows the chef placing corn on the grill using tongs. He then turns away briefly. While his back is turned, the piece of meat appears on the grill without him placing it there. His surprised reaction upon turning back and looking upwards suggests the meat arrived unexpectedly from above, linking to the earlier scene in the hot air balloon, rather than being placed by him with tongs."
1294-7,D
1298-0,"The man's football did not return to him because it was deflated. Unlike the boy's ball, which bounced back effectively from the wall, the man's ball lacked sufficient air pressure, causing it to absorb the impact and drop straight down instead of rebounding."
1298-1,"The man's football did not come back to him because it experienced a highly inelastic collision with the wall.

**Explanation:** Unlike the boy's ball which rebounded effectively, the man's ball lost most of its kinetic energy upon impact. This energy was likely dissipated as heat, sound, and deformation of the ball or wall surface. Potential reasons for this include the ball being underinflated, made of a less bouncy material, or hitting the wall at an angle and speed that maximized energy absorption rather than reflection."
1298-2,"No, the man's football did not land in the blue bucket.

**Explanation:** The video shows two people throwing footballs. The boy throws his white and patterned football, which lands inside the blue bucket. The man throws his yellow and green football upwards, and it comes back down near him, not near the bucket. Therefore, the man's football did return (came down), and it was the boy's football that landed in the bucket."
1298-3,"No, the man's football was not intercepted by the dog. The video shows the man throwing a yellow ball initially, but the subsequent action focuses on a boy throwing a white football. It is the boy's white football that is intercepted by the dog as it bounces back from the wall."
1298-7,C
1299-0,"The elevator door closed because the girl inside, who was physically holding it open, removed her hand. Elevators have automatic closing mechanisms, and once her hand was no longer obstructing the door or holding the 'door open' button/sensor, the door began its standard closing sequence."
1299-1,"The elevator door shut because its automatic closing mechanism was activated. Elevators are programmed with a timer that automatically closes the doors after a set period, even if the 'door open' button is being pressed, to prevent them from being held open indefinitely and ensure efficient operation."
1299-2,"Yes, the elevator door closed automatically. The girl was actively pressing the 'door open' button, but the door still closed, indicating that the system's pre-set maximum hold time (buffer time) had expired, overriding her manual command."
1299-3,"No, the elevator door did not close because the person inside pressed the button to close it. The video shows the door starting to close automatically while the person inside is still holding it open and looking out. She only presses the 'door close' button after the door has already shut."
1299-7,B
1307-0,"**Increased Speed Difference:** After passing the ramp, the speed difference between the two tires increases.

*   **Explanation:** The video shows that while the tires start relatively close, after passing the location of the ramp (which they miss), one tire clearly covers more forward distance downhill than the other. This growing separation indicates that one tire is traveling faster than the other, meaning their speed difference has increased."
1307-1,"The speed difference between the two tires increases after they move forward past the ramp.

Explanation: Initially, both tires roll down the hill at similar speeds. However, after passing the location of the ramp (which they both miss), the larger tire visibly pulls ahead of the smaller tire, covering more ground in the same amount of time. This indicates that the larger tire is moving faster than the smaller tire, and the difference in their speeds has become greater than it was before passing the ramp area."
1307-2,"No, the tire initially lagging behind does not surpass the leading tire after the ramp area. Both tires actually miss the ramp entirely, and the tire that started in the lead maintains its lead over the lagging tire as they continue rolling down the hill past the ramp's location."
1307-3,"No, the tire that takes the lead at the start does not remain in the lead all the time. The larger tire starts ahead, but the smaller tire overtakes it partway down the hill."
1307-7,B
1308-0,"The speed of the black missile increases significantly after it appears. It accelerates rapidly, as shown by the exhaust trail and how quickly it moves across the screen and overtakes the previously shown bullet. After this initial acceleration, it appears to maintain a very high speed."
1308-1,"The black missile accelerates rapidly throughout the animation.

**Explanation:** The missile appears initially moving slower than its final speed and quickly increases its velocity, evidenced by the visible engine propulsion (smoke trail) and its swift movement overtaking the bullet and traversing the environment."
1308-2,"No, the black missile in the animation does not decelerate to match the bullet's speed before accelerating rapidly. The animation shows the black missile appearing alongside the bullet, seemingly at a comparable or slightly faster initial speed, and then immediately accelerating significantly, leaving the bullet behind. There is no visual indication of a deceleration phase for the missile."
1308-3,"**No**, the speed of the black missile in the animation does not appear to keep increasing throughout the entire sequence shown. While it clearly accelerates rapidly during its launch phase to overtake the bullet, it then seems to travel at a sustained, extremely high (hypersonic) speed through the subsequent environment. The animation focuses on demonstrating the missile's achieved high velocity compared to the bullet, rather than depicting continuous acceleration."
1308-7,A
1310-0,The man used less time in completing the game. He successfully collected all his designated pink balls and deposited them into his hoop before the woman finished collecting her red/white balls.
1310-1,"Based on the video, the **man** finished the game in the shortest amount of time.

**Explanation:** Both participants start collecting the balls after a rock-paper-scissors game. They collect one ball at a time using their feet and place it into the hoops in front of them. Observing the final moments, the man successfully places his last ball into his designated hoop slightly before the woman places her final ball into hers."
1310-2,"No, Michiel did not complete the game faster than Celine. Celine placed her final ball into her hoop just slightly before Michiel placed his final ball into his hoop."
1310-3,"**No**, Celine did not finish the game faster. Michiel actually finished collecting all his balls first. The soccer ball icons above their names were just a way to keep score, showing how many balls each person had collected at any given moment, not a factor that influenced their speed."
1310-7,B
1312-0,"Yes, the treadmill is running while the person in the video is pretending to sleep. You can see the person sliding backward along the treadmill belt, which indicates the belt is moving."
1312-1,"Yes, the treadmill was active while the person was trying to sleep.

**Explanation:** In the video segment labeled ""Sleeping,"" the treadmill belt is visibly moving, causing the person lying on it under a blanket to slide backward. The person has to repeatedly adjust their position by pulling themselves forward, confirming the treadmill was turned on and running."
1312-2,"Yes, the person in the video had to crawl forward to avoid falling off the treadmill. The treadmill belt was actively moving backward while they were lying on it (pretending to sleep), and this movement continuously pushed them toward the back edge. To counteract this and stay on the machine, they had to repeatedly crawl forward."
1312-3,"No, the treadmill belt was not stationary while the person was sleeping. The video clearly shows the belt moving backward, causing the person lying under the blanket to slide along with it and eventually start falling off the end."
1312-7,C
1318-0,"The daughter appears **unimpressed and unamused** at the end.

**Explanation:** While her dad is acting silly and mimicking a cat, she maintains a neutral, almost deadpan expression. She isn't laughing or smiling; instead, she looks slightly away with a stoic face, suggesting she is not entertained by his performance and perhaps resigned to his indirect way of responding to her request."
1318-1,"**Unimpressed and Confused:** The daughter maintains a neutral, almost blank facial expression while watching her dad's exaggerated cat impression. She doesn't smile, laugh, or show any amusement, indicating she is likely unimpressed and possibly confused by his strange behavior in response to her request."
1318-2,"**No**, the daughter does not seem speechless. Her facial expression at the end appears more unimpressed, resigned, or perhaps slightly annoyed by her father's antics, rather than shocked or surprised to the point of being unable to speak."
1318-3,"**No**, the daughter does not appear amused or entertained by her father's antics at the end. Her facial expression is neutral to unimpressed, and she looks straight ahead rather than engaging with or laughing at her father's cat impression."
1318-7,C
1321-0,"**Happy:** The girl is smiling and looking up attentively at the end of the video, indicating she is happy and engaged with the event taking place around her."
1321-1,"**Happy and Engaged.**

**Explanation:** At the conclusion of the video, the girl with braids is looking upwards with a slight smile on her face. This expression, combined with her focused attention on whatever the crowd is watching, suggests she is feeling happy, positively engaged, and enjoying the event."
1321-2,"No, the girl with braids does not appear dazed and confused by the actions of the man next to her at the end of the video.

**Explanation:**

At the end of the video, the girl with braids looks upwards in the same direction the man is looking and pointing. She has a slight smile and appears engaged with whatever they are observing, along with the rest of the crowd. Her expression suggests curiosity or enjoyment of the event, not confusion about the man's actions."
1321-3,"Yes, the girl with braids appears happy at the end of the video.

**Explanation:** Towards the end of the clip (around 00:20-00:22), she looks towards the camera with a noticeable smile, suggesting she is enjoying herself at the event."
1321-7,A
1324-0,"**Mood:** Startled/Shocked.

*   **Explanation:** Both the man and woman exhibit wide eyes and slightly open mouths at the very end. This occurs immediately after the man, having just demonstrated breaking an apple, a toilet paper roll, and a water bottle, takes the dog from the woman and makes a motion as if to break it too, before abruptly stopping himself. They are shocked by the near-miss and the sudden realization that he almost harmed the living animal by reflexively continuing the pattern established with inanimate objects."
1324-1,"At the conclusion of the video, the man and woman appear shocked and concerned. These emotions are caused when the woman pulls on the small dog's front leg while the man is holding it, leading them to believe they may have accidentally injured the dog."
1324-2,"No, the man and woman experience shock, but not remorse, and the man's actions were not due to distraction.

*   **Shock:** Both the man and woman display clear facial expressions of shock and alarm at the very end when the man positions his hands as if to break the dog, mirroring his previous actions with the apple, toilet paper, and water bottle.
*   **Remorse:** The video cuts off immediately after the moment of shock. There is no time depicted for either person to show remorse (regret or guilt) for the near-action.
*   **Cause:** The man's action wasn't one of distraction. He was intentionally repeating the pattern of breaking items handed to him. The shock stems from the realization that he almost applied this focused, repetitive action to a living dog."
1324-3,"**Answer:** No, the man and woman do not appear to be in a light-hearted and playful mood at the end of the video.

**Explanation:** While the preceding interactions involving breaking objects might have been playful or part of a trick, the final interaction where the man takes the dog and a ""breaking"" sound effect plays causes both the man and woman to display expressions of shock and concern, suggesting the mood shifted away from light-heartedness."
1324-7,C
1329-0,"**Mood:** Playfully annoyed/Exasperated.

**Why:** The woman was in the middle of a relaxing yoga pose (child's pose) when the man entered with the child. After setting the child down, the man immediately sat on the couch to relax himself. The woman's quick jump up and rush towards him suggests a playful exasperation or annoyance that her moment of peace was interrupted, and he instantly tried to claim his own relaxation time, fitting the video's caption ""King of a few seconds""."
1329-1,"**Feeling:** Playfully annoyed and amused.
**Cause:** The man unexpectedly swatted her on the bottom while she was doing yoga.
**Explanation:** She was focused on her yoga pose when the man playfully swatted her. This unexpected action startled her and prompted an immediate, lighthearted reaction where she jumps up to chase him, indicating playful annoyance or mock indignation rather than genuine anger."
1329-2,"Yes, the woman's mood appears to reflect frustration or annoyance.

**Explanation:** She was in the middle of a yoga pose, likely seeking relaxation or focus. The man enters, puts down the child, and immediately sits down to relax himself (as implied by the text ""King of a few seconds""). Her instant reaction is to abandon her pose and chase after him, suggesting she is annoyed by the interruption and his immediate transition to leisure while her own activity was cut short."
1329-3,"No, the woman's mood at the end of the video does not appear to be one of confusion and curiosity.

**Explanation:** When the man abruptly gets up and runs towards her, she instantly jumps up from her yoga pose and runs away. This immediate, reactive escape suggests she anticipated or understood his playful intention (like initiating a chase or a playful tackle) rather than being confused or curious about his actions. Her response is one of quick reaction and engagement in the playful moment, not bewilderment."
1329-7,D
1344-0,"The baby smiles after the injection primarily out of relief because the pain has stopped. The initial crying was a direct response to the painful stimulus of the needle. Once the injection is over and the source of pain is removed, the baby quickly assesses the situation (as suggested by the text ""Is that all?"" and ""It wasn't that painful"") and expresses relief and a return to a happy state by smiling."
1344-1,"The child smiles after receiving the injection because the adult holding them begins to interact playfully immediately after the procedure is finished.

*   **Explanation:** After the initial pain causes the baby to cry, the injection process quickly concludes. The adult then starts bouncing and engaging with the baby. This playful interaction serves as a distraction, shifts the baby's focus away from any lingering discomfort, and successfully changes their emotional state from distress to amusement, leading to the smile and laughter."
1344-2,"Yes, the child smiles after the injection because the pain subsides once the needle is removed.

**Explanation:** The video shows the baby crying intensely immediately after the needle is inserted, indicating pain. Once the needle is removed and a bandage is applied, the baby stops crying, looks briefly surprised or confused, and then breaks into a wide smile and laughs. This quick transition from distress to happiness strongly suggests that the smile is a reaction to the pain stopping."
1344-3,"Yes, the smile is likely partially due to being comforted, but it appears to be more strongly linked to relief and processing the event.

*   **Explanation:** The baby cries immediately from the pain of the injection. The comfort from being held securely likely helps the baby calm down quickly once the painful stimulus stops. However, the distinct pause, followed by a look of confusion and then a broad smile and happy bouncing, suggests the baby realized the pain was over and brief. This relief, combined with the secure feeling and potentially mirroring the adult's smile, leads to the happy expression."
