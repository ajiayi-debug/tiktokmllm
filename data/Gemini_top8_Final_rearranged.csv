0008-0,"The first two people only tapped the bottle cap repeatedly with a small object, which failed to open the bottle. The last person, after initially tapping, successfully opened the bottle by using a different technique: a forceful hand strike near the cap."
0008-1,"The last person's actions differ because they are performing a magic trick or sleight of hand, making the cap seemingly vanish with a hand gesture after initially mimicking the tapping. This contrasts with the first two individuals who are genuinely, but unsuccessfully, attempting to physically open the bottle by repeatedly tapping the cap with a tool. His action is performative and achieves an illusion, while the others attempt a practical (but failed) method."
0008-2,"Yes, the last person opened the bottle without using a knife. They tapped the cap with a chopstick (or similar object) and then appeared to use a hand gesture or trick to remove the cap."
0008-3,"No, the last person did not open the bottle *with* the knife in the conventional sense. While the first two people failed in their attempts, the last person performed a trick where the cap came off after tapping it with a knife/stick and making a hand gesture, rather than using the knife as a tool to pry it open."

0012-0,"**4**

**Explanation:** The video shows four distinct figures dressed in robotic-style suits standing together on a stage under the ""EX ROBOT"" sign."
0012-1,"**Answer:** 3
**Explanation:** The video initially shows one robot figure walking, and later scenes show this robot standing together with two other distinct robot figures, making a total of three."
0012-2,"Yes, the video displays four robot figures in total. Initially, one robot is shown walking, and later, a group of four distinct robot figures are seen standing together on display."
0012-3,"No, there are more than two robot figures shown in the video. At least four distinct robot figures are visible on the stage."

0016-0,"The person is facing **both forward and right**.

**Explanation:** This image is an optical illusion. The overall silhouette (forehead, nose, lips, chin, ear) clearly forms a profile view of a face looking towards the **right**. However, the person's eye is looking directly out at the viewer, creating the perception that they are facing **forward**."
0016-1,"**Answer:** Two directions are possible: straight ahead or to the right.

**Explanation:** This image is an optical illusion. You can perceive it as a person looking directly forward (straight ahead) at the viewer, focusing on the central eye, nose, and mouth. Alternatively, you can perceive the outline of the face as a profile looking towards the right side of the image."
0016-2,"**Yes.** The image shows the person's nose, lips, and chin in profile (sideways view), while the eye is looking directly forward (frontal view). This combination of perspectives is anatomically impossible to capture in a single, unedited photograph from one angle, indicating that the image has been created using photo editing or digital manipulation techniques."
0016-3,"**Yes**, the person appears to be facing forward based on the shoulders.

**Explanation:** The shoulders and the neckline of the shirt are depicted symmetrically. This balanced presentation is typically used to represent a person whose torso is oriented directly towards the viewer, even though the face itself is an optical illusion that can be seen in profile as well."

0036-0,"The thinness of the slices is achieved because the zucchini is fed towards the blades very slowly and precisely by the conveyor mechanism. The rapid cutting action is due to the combination of multiple sharp blades on the rotating disc and the speed at the blade tips, resulting in many cuts occurring per second even if the overall rotation doesn't look extremely fast."
0036-1,"The machine achieves thin slices despite the *apparent* slow spin primarily because:

1.  **High Actual Rotational Speed (RPM):** The blade assembly is likely spinning much faster during the actual cutting process than it might appear, especially during spin-up or due to video frame rate limitations.
2.  **Multiple Blades:** The rotating disc has multiple cutting blades. Even at a moderate RPM, having several blades means that a cut occurs multiple times per single revolution, significantly increasing the slicing frequency.
3.  **Controlled Feed Rate:** The green conveyor belt precisely controls how quickly the zucchini advances towards the blades. This ensures only a very thin layer is presented to the blades for each pass, resulting in thin slices regardless of the exact rotational speed (though higher speed allows for faster overall processing).

In essence, the combination of high actual blade speed, multiple cutting edges per rotation, and a precisely controlled feed rate allows the machine to produce thin slices rapidly, even if the rotation doesn't look exceptionally fast to the naked eye or on video."
0036-2,"**Answer:** No, the thin slicing is a result of the machine's mechanical design, specifically the relationship between the speed at which the zucchini is fed into the machine and the speed/path of the cutting blade(s). The stroboscopic effect is a visual illusion related to how rapid motion is perceived and does not affect the physical thickness of the slices being cut."
0036-3,"**Answer:**

No, it's a combination of factors. While blade sharpness is essential to initiate a clean, thin cut without crushing the zucchini, the high rotational speed observed in the video is also critical for achieving such uniform slices rapidly and efficiently. Sharpness enables the thin cut, but the speed ensures the cut is completed quickly and cleanly before the material can deform, contributing significantly to the overall performance. Reducing the speed significantly would likely compromise the quality or rate of slicing, even with a sharp blade."

0037-0,"There are **10** distinct artificially edited parts in the video.

**Explanation:** These edits include the text overlay, the erratic movement of the cup, the character T-posing, the floating ball, the pixelation effect, the missing texture effect, the appearance of the ""ERROR"" text, the duplicate character, the spawning of multiple balls, and the distorted audio. Each of these is an artificial visual or audio effect added to simulate a video game glitch."
0037-1,"**Answer:** 6 sections.

**Explanation:** The video shows signs of artificial editing in six distinct sections, each simulating a different type of video game glitch:
1.  Erratic object movement (the shaking cup).
2.  Character T-posing and unnatural object physics (the man freezing with the floating ball).
3.  Texture/model corruption (the man and cup becoming pixelated).
4.  Missing textures and error messages (the checkerboard pattern and ""ERROR"" text).
5.  Character duplication (a second T-posing man appearing).
6.  Object duplication/physics anomalies (the swarm of bouncing balls)."
0037-2,"**Yes**, the video is edited in multiple parts to create the effect of video game glitches. The unnatural movements of the cup, the man freezing in a T-pose, the changes in his appearance (pixelated, missing texture), the appearance of the ""ERROR"" text, the duplication of the man, and the multiplication of the ping pong balls are all visual effects added in post-production editing to mimic common glitches found in video games."
0037-3,"**No**, the video is not edited only in one part.

**Explanation:** The video showcases multiple distinct types of video game glitches (object jittering, character T-posing, texture errors, character duplication, physics anomalies) that appear sequentially and affect different elements (the cup, the person, the ball) at various points throughout the clip, indicating editing was applied in multiple segments."
0037-7,E
0038-0,"The last person was able to snap off the cap easily because **repeatedly tapping the bottle agitated the carbonated liquid, causing dissolved CO2 gas to rapidly come out of solution.** This significantly **increased the internal pressure** inside the bottle, which exerted a strong upward force on the cap. The final sharp strike then only needed to provide a small amount of force to break the cap's seal, as the built-up pressure did most of the work in popping it off."
0038-1,"The last person successfully removed the bottle cap because they used the chopstick to apply a sharp, upward force *under* the rim of the cap. This action created leverage, using the bottle lip as a fulcrum and the chopstick as a lever, effectively prying the cap off in a manner similar to a bottle opener. The first two individuals merely tapped the top or side of the cap, which does not generate the necessary upward force to break the seal."
0038-2,"Yes, the last person successfully broke the bottle. The video shows the top of the Coca-Cola bottle breaking off cleanly after his action."
0038-3,"Yes, the last person used a lighter as a lever, placing it under the cap's edge and applying upward force against the bottle neck to pop the cap off."
0038-7,E
0064-0,"The room went dark because an unseen entity, whose eyes appear shortly after, turned off the bedside lamp. The distinct ""click"" sound heard when the light goes out indicates that the lamp's physical switch was flipped by this other character, confirming the stick figure was not actually home alone and setting up the scare."
0064-1,"The room became dark because the lamp on the dresser, the only visible light source within the bedroom, was turned off at the same moment the stick figure shut the door."
0064-2,"Yes, the room went dark because the stick figure slammed the door shut, and the force or vibration from the impact caused the lamp on the nearby dresser to fall over, extinguishing the light."
0064-3,"No, the room did not go dark because the character hit the light switch when closing the door.

**Explanation:** The video shows the hallway light turning off as the character runs *away* from the switch and towards the stairs. The action of closing a door happens later, in a different room (the bedroom), and is unrelated to the hallway light turning off."
0064-7,E
0070-0,"The person in the video poured the water 2 times. They pour once at the beginning, pause to react and think, and then pour a second time."
0070-1,"**2 times:** The person pours water initially, pauses, and then pours water a second time."
0070-2,"Yes, the person poured the water twice. The video shows the action of pouring water from the green mug into the black mug happening two separate times, once at the beginning (around 0:01-0:02) and again after an edited reaction sequence (around 0:08-0:12)."
0070-3,"No, the person did not pour the water once. They poured water initially, paused after a meme overlay appeared and they reacted, and then poured water a second time."

0080-0,"The purpose of beating the balloon is to break the inner container holding the vinegar, allowing it to mix with the baking soda. This initiates a chemical reaction that produces carbon dioxide gas, causing the balloon to self-inflate."
0080-1,"You need to hit the balloon to break the inner packets containing vinegar and baking soda. This allows the chemicals to mix, initiating a chemical reaction that produces carbon dioxide gas, which inflates the balloon."
0080-2,"Yes, the purpose of creating these balloons, which are then hit, is to make a fun and interactive toy. The hitting action shown at the end demonstrates the intended play and interaction with the squishy, face-adorned balloons, confirming they are meant as toys for amusement and sensory engagement."
0080-3,"**No.** The purpose of hitting the balloon is to break the inner container (the glove finger holding vinegar), allowing the vinegar to mix with the baking soda inside the balloon. This initiates a chemical reaction that produces carbon dioxide gas, causing the balloon to self-inflate."
0080-7,A
0081-0,"The man puts his hand on his face as a playful reaction, likely feigning slight embarrassment or suppressing amusement in response to the woman starting her cute dance for the video trend."
0081-1,"The man covers his face as a playful gesture, likely feigning shyness or slight embarrassment in reaction to the woman's cute dance and the filter, adding a comedic or endearing beat to the video before he joins in."
0081-2,"Yes, the man covers his face, and the filter immediately transfers from him to the woman. This sequence indicates his action caused the transfer."
0081-3,"**Answer:** No

**Explanation:** The man brings his hand up towards his face while the woman performs different gestures (pointing downwards and then making a finger heart). Their movements at this specific moment are distinct and not performed in unison or as mirrored actions, indicating this particular hand-to-face gesture is not synchronized between them."
0081-7,D
0083-0,"**Answer:** The video showcases a car featuring innovative, dynamic color-changing technology, likely as a promotion for the Porsche brand.

**Explanation:** The core action in the video is a car parked on a street repeatedly changing its exterior color to perfectly match the outfits of different individuals walking past it (a man in blue, a woman in purple, a man in green, a woman in red). This demonstrates a futuristic concept of extreme personalization and adaptability, linking the vehicle directly to fashion and individual style. The surprised reactions of the onlookers emphasize the novelty and ""wow"" factor of the technology, aiming to generate buzz and excitement, likely for marketing purposes."
0083-1,"The message conveyed by the repeated instances of people walking past the color-changing car is the **demonstration of advanced, versatile personalization technology.**

**Explanation:** Each time a person walks by and the car changes color to match their outfit, it reinforces the car's capability. The repetition emphasizes that this isn't a single trick but a feature that can adapt dynamically and repeatedly to different individuals and styles, showcasing both the versatility of the color options and the responsiveness of the underlying technology."
0083-2,"**No**, the video does not show a daughter trying to uncover her mother's feelings about a pet dog.

**Explanation:** The video shows people reacting with surprise as a car parked on a street changes color multiple times, seemingly matching the outfits of different pedestrians walking past it. The setting is outdoors near a cafe, and the dialogue is about the car's color-changing ability. There are no characters identifiable as a mother or daughter, no pet dog, no room being entered, and no discussion related to feelings about a pet."
0083-3,"No, the video does not show a daughter repeatedly entering a room to announce a pet dog or highlight cultural differences. The video shows a car parked on a street that changes color to match the outfits of people walking past it, as observed by people sitting at an outdoor cafe table."

*   **Explanation:** The video zooms in significantly at approximately 0:09, 0:13, 0:54, and 0:56 to focus on specific intersection points or details of the lines being drawn."
0099-1,"**2**

**Explanation:** The video zooms in for a close-up view twice: the first time occurs around the 0:09 mark, and the second, closer zoom happens around the 0:54 mark."
0099-2,"**Yes**: The video contains two distinct moments where the view zooms in significantly on the pattern being generated. The first occurs around 0:09 as the pattern begins to show complexity, and the second, much tighter zoom occurs around 0:54, focusing on the moving point within the dense final pattern."
0099-3,"No, the video does not contain 10 zoomed-in close-ups.

**Explanation:** The video shows the generation of a complex pattern. There are only two instances where the view zooms in significantly: once around the 9-second mark focusing on the moving point and the lines it's drawing, and again near the end (around 54 seconds) focusing on the dense center of the completed pattern."

**Explanation:**
The man first appears inside the bookshelf unit, then inside the sofa's storage compartment, followed by inside the cardboard box, and finally reappears on the floor behind the dog near the initial doorway."
0101-1,"The order of locations where the man appears after teleporting is:
1.  Bookshelf
2.  Sofa
3.  Cardboard box"
0101-2,"**Answer:** No, the man does not teleport.

**Explanation:** The video uses editing tricks and visual effects to create the illusion that the man is instantly moving between locations or hiding in impossible places (like inside the bookshelf or couch). These are creative video production techniques, not actual teleportation."
0101-3,"No, the sequence described is incorrect.
*   **Explanation:** The man first appears hidden in the bookshelf (0:03), then inside the couch (0:08), then inside the cardboard box (0:15), and finally crawls out from under the blanket towards the dog (0:20). The correct sequence is Bookshelf -> Couch -> Cardboard Box -> Blanket (return)."

**Explanation:** The video shows the person leaning in quickly towards the cats on the counter while simultaneously making a sharp, loud vocal sound. This abrupt combination of movement and noise startled the cats, triggering their immediate flight response, causing them to jump off the counter."
0242-1,"The two orange cats leaped away because the person made a sudden, loud, high-pitched noise (vocalization/squeal) and lunged forward slightly, startling them."
0242-2,"Yes, the two orange cats jumped away because the person in the red hat made a sudden, loud noise that sounded like a party blower, startling them."
0242-3,"**No**, the video does not show two orange cats jumping away because they were frightened by a toy snake.

**Explanation:** While the video compilation shows various cats reacting fearfully to different stimuli (including toy snakes in some clips), the specific instance where two cats jump away together (around 0:08-0:10) involves one orange cat and one dark-colored cat, and no toy snake is visible as the cause of their fright in that scene."

0248-0,"The person is painting a highlight onto a painted water droplet on a large, hyperrealistic portrait using a fine brush.

**Explanation:** The video shows an artist meticulously applying a small dot of white paint with a fine brush onto what is clearly a large painting of a woman's face covered in water droplets. This dot represents the reflection of light (a highlight) on the surface of the painted droplet, enhancing the painting's realism and creating the illusion of wetness."
0248-1,"**Activity:** Painting fine details on a hyperrealistic portrait.

**Explanation:** The person is using a very fine paintbrush to apply a small dab of white paint onto a large, highly realistic painting of a woman's face. This specific action involves adding intricate details, likely a highlight on a water droplet or wet skin, to enhance the painting's realism."
0248-2,"**Yes**, the person in the foreground is painting a hyperrealistic image of a wet-haired woman.

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows a hand using a fine paintbrush to apply paint, specifically adding highlights to water droplets on a large-scale, extremely detailed image of a woman's face. This meticulous technique, aimed at achieving photographic realism, confirms it is the process of creating a hyperrealistic painting."
0248-3,"**No.** The artist is shown actively painting a highlight onto one of the ""water droplets"" on the person's face. This demonstrates that the wet appearance is a hyperrealistic effect created with paint, not actual water."

0251-0,"The ball falls off because the movement of the mechanical straw figures supporting the large disc causes the disc to tilt. When the disc tilts sufficiently downwards at the edge where the ball is located, gravity pulls the ball along the created slope and over the edge."
0251-1,"The ball falls off the disc because the programmed mechanical movement of the straw figures supporting the disc causes it to tilt significantly. This sharp tilt creates a steep incline, and gravity pulls the ball down this slope and off the edge."
0251-2,"**No.**

**Explanation:** The ball's movement is an integral part of the kinetic art installation, ""The Round Table"". The headless straw figures underneath the disc are mechanical and move in a programmed sequence. Their movement causes the large disc to tilt, and it is this tilting action that makes the ball roll across the surface and eventually off the edge due to gravity, not because it was thrown."
0251-3,"Yes, the ball fell off the disc because the disc was tilted, causing it to roll off due to gravity.

**Explanation:** The movement of the straw figures underneath the disc caused it to tilt. This tilting created an inclined surface. The force of gravity then pulled the ball down this incline, causing it to roll towards the edge and eventually fall off."

0256-0,"**14**

**Explanation:** The ping-pong ball bounces 13 times on the stair treads as it goes down and makes a final 14th bounce as it lands inside the cup at the bottom."
0256-1,"**16**

**Explanation:** The ping-pong ball bounces 12 times on the individual stairs and then 4 more times on the landing at the bottom before going into the glass, totaling 16 bounces."
0256-2,"No, the ping-pong ball does not bounce 17 times. It bounces 15 times before landing in the cup."
0256-3,"**Answer:** Yes, the ping-pong ball bounces 15 times.
**Explanation:** By carefully watching the video and counting each impact, the ball is observed bouncing 15 times as it travels down the stairs and onto the landing."

0259-0,**Right hand:** He uses his right hand to grab the hat off his head and throw it away in frustration at 00:11.
0259-1,"The man discarded his hat with his **right hand**.

**Explanation:** At approximately the 00:11 mark in the video, after expressing frustration, the man reaches up with his right hand, removes the hat from his head, and throws it backwards."
0259-2,"**No**, the man did not throw his hat away with his left hand. His hat remains on his head throughout the entire video clip, even during his moments of frustration after missing the shots."
0259-3,"No, the man did not throw away his hat. He threw away a tiny golf club with his right hand."
0259-7,D
0266-0,"**Right thumb.**

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows the yellow rubber band forming a continuous loop around the thumb of the person's right hand (the hand on the right side of the screen from the viewer's perspective) throughout the demonstration."
0266-1,"**Answer:** Right thumb.

**Explanation:** The video shows the yellow rubber band is consistently looped around the base of the person's right thumb throughout the entire sequence of manipulations."
0266-2,**No.** The video shows the rubber band being hooked and manipulated primarily by the left index finger. The band does not form a complete loop around the left thumb at any point during the trick.
0266-3,"**Answer:** Yes.
**Explanation:** At the start of the video (0:00), the yellow rubber band forms a complete loop around the right thumb and index finger."
0266-7,C
0267-0,"The person is lying on the ground on a sports court, posing for a photo taken from directly above to create the optical illusion of hanging from the white line using forced perspective."
0267-1,"The person is **pretending to hang** from the white line.

**Explanation:** The person is lying flat on a sports court, positioned under a white line. By raising one arm as if gripping the line and arranging their body, combined with the overhead camera angle, they create a forced perspective optical illusion that makes it appear as though they are hanging from the line."
0267-2,"Yes, the person is creating an illusion by lying on the basketball court. The photo is taken from directly above (a bird's-eye view), which creates the false perspective that they are floating or hanging in mid-air."
0267-3,"**Answer:** Yes, the person in the video appears to be jumping or leaping in the air.

**Explanation:** The image captures the person suspended above the ground surface, with their feet clearly not in contact with it. Their body position and the presence of a shadow underneath them indicate they are airborne, consistent with the action of having jumped or leaped."
0267-7,C
0273-0,"**Yellow.**

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows the person holding the solved Rubik's Cube up at the end (around the 0:09 mark), and the face pointing upwards is entirely yellow."
0273-1,"**White.**

When the person holds up the solved Rubik's Cube at the end of the video (around 0:08-0:09), the top face is clearly visible as white."
0273-2,"**No:** The top face of the solved Rubik's Cube is yellow, not white, as clearly shown in the video when the person finishes solving it."
0273-3,"**Answer:** No, the top color of the solved Rubik's Cube is white.

**Explanation:** When the person finishes solving the cube and holds it up around the 0:09-0:10 mark, the face clearly visible on top is white."
0273-7,B
0274-0,"There are **5** people in the video.

**Explanation:**

One dancer is featured prominently in the center, while four other dancers (two male, two female) are visible performing the choreography behind and alongside him throughout the clip."
0274-1,"**Answer:** 5
**Explanation:** There are five distinct dancers visible in the frame throughout the video clip: one central male dancer and four other dancers positioned around him (two male, two female)."
0274-2,"**No.** There are consistently five dancers visible throughout the clip. A visual count confirms only five people are present, not seven."
0274-3,"No, the total number of people visible in the video is five, not six. Throughout the clip, a maximum of five individuals can be seen dancing at any one time."
0274-7,D
0276-0,"**No.**

The illusion is created practically using an anamorphic drawing technique combined with physical manipulation of the paper. The cube is drawn in a distorted way that appears 3D from the camera's specific angle. Crucially, the paper is cut along the top edges of the cube and folded upwards, allowing the real pencil to physically pass behind the standing portion of the drawing, creating the illusion without video editing effects. The reveal at the end confirms this physical setup."
0276-1,"The illusion is created using several techniques:

1.  **Cut-Out Drawing:** The drawing of the cube is physically cut out from the paper along its bottom and side edges.
2.  **Anamorphic Perspective & Shading:** The cube is drawn with distorted perspective and shading to appear three-dimensional only from a specific viewpoint.
3.  **Strategic Camera Angle:** The video is filmed from the precise angle required for the drawing to look like a 3D object.
4.  **Physical Gap & Occlusion:** The cut-out creates a physical space behind the visible part of the drawing. The pen slides into this gap, and the cut-out paper physically blocks the view (occlusion), making it seem like the pen is going underneath the ""solid"" cube.
5.  **Drawn Shadow:** The shadow enhances the illusion of the cube lifting off the page, reinforcing the idea of space beneath it."
0276-2,"**Answer:** No, the illusion does not rely on video editing effects like masking.

**Explanation:** This is a practical optical illusion created with paper. The cube is drawn, and then a portion of the paper around the top/back of the drawing is cut out and folded upwards. The pencil physically passes *behind* this folded, upright section of the paper. Due to the specific viewing angle and the drawing technique, this creates the convincing illusion that the pencil is passing *under* a solid 3D cube. The end of the video confirms this by showing how the paper is cut and folded."
0276-3,"**Yes, the illusion is created solely through skillful drawing and perspective without any video editing.**

**Explanation:**
The effect is achieved using a technique called anamorphic drawing combined with paper cutting and folding. The cube is drawn distorted on a piece of paper, which is then cut and folded so that a portion stands upright. When viewed from the specific angle of the camera, the drawing aligns perfectly to create the illusion of a 3D cube. The pencil appears to pass through the cube because it is actually passing behind the folded, upright section of the paper, as revealed at the end of the video."

0278-0,"The writing on the paper is in two colors:
1.  **Black:** The initial problem statement (""Factor the polynomial. 3x³ + x² - 15x - 5"") is written in black.
2.  **Orange/Red:** The steps showing the factoring process are written using an orange marker, which appears as a reddish-orange color on the paper."
0278-1,"**Answer:** Black and Red.

**Explanation:** The paper displays text in two colors. The initial problem (""Factor the polynomial. 3x³ + x² - 15x - 5"") is written in black, while the handwritten steps showing the factorization process are written in red ink."
0278-2,"No, the writing on the paper is black and red."
0278-3,"Yes, the writing on the paper in the video is red. The mathematical steps shown for factoring the polynomial, including the grouping, factoring out common terms, and the final answer, are written using a red marker."
0278-7,C
0288-0,"**The large cleaver** used throughout the demonstration.

**Explanation:** While the main demonstrator uses it with ease, the woman assisting clearly struggles to slice the piece of meat/fat with it towards the end of the video (around 0:54-0:58), even when instructed to use two hands. Her difficulty indicates the knife requires considerable force or specific technique, making it not easy to use for her or for that particular task."
0288-1,"The large cleaver is difficult to use.

**Explanation:** The woman participant requires specific instructions, needs to use two hands for stability and force when cutting the paper towel roll and the piece of meat, and struggles to achieve a clean slice on the meat, prompting the demonstrator to comment, ""we have a problem."" This contrasts sharply with the ease and precision the man demonstrates, highlighting the skill required to wield the cleaver effectively and its inherent difficulty for a less experienced user."
0288-2,"No, the knife that the woman found difficult to use in the video is the large, shiny steel cleaver, not a knife with a darker black steel part. The video clearly shows her struggling to cut items effectively with the shiny cleaver provided by the main demonstrator."
0288-3,"Yes, the lighter silver steel knife is shown to be difficult to use.

**Explanation:** While the woman uses the silver knife easily on softer items like paper towels and cloth, she visibly struggles to cut the thick piece of pork belly towards the end of the video (around 0:54). She needs to use two hands and a sawing motion, and the cut is not clean, indicating difficulty with that specific task compared to the ease demonstrated with the other knife."
0288-7,C
0291-0,"**Answer:**

The rotation of the metal rod is caused by a reactive force generated by the expulsion of ionized air from its tips.

**Explanation:**

The high voltage from the device ionizes the air molecules concentrated at the sharp ends of the metal rod (corona discharge). These newly formed ions are then strongly repelled and accelerated away from the tips by the intense electric field. According to Newton's third law, this expulsion of ions creates an equal and opposite reactive force (thrust) on the rod ends. This force acts tangentially to the pivot point, generating a net torque that causes the rod to spin. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as ion wind, electric wind, or the principle behind an electric whirl/corona motor."
0291-1,"**Initiation:** Bringing the handheld conductor close concentrated the electric field, initiating strong, directed plasma discharges specifically from the pivoted rod's tips. This provided the initial torque to overcome static friction and start the rotation.

**Continuation:** The rotation is sustained because the Tesla coil continuously supplies high voltage to the rod. This causes ongoing corona discharge (plasma ejection or ion wind) from the sharp tips. According to Newton's Third Law, the reaction force from expelling this ionized air away from the tips generates a continuous torque, keeping the rod spinning (acting as a corona motor)."
0291-2,"Yes, the initial rotation of the metal rod started because a human plucked or pushed it.

**Explanation:**
The video clearly shows at the 0:03-0:04 second mark that a finger makes contact with the small metal rod balanced on the central electrode, imparting a push or flick that initiates its spinning motion. Before this physical interaction, the rod was stationary."
0291-3,"**No.**

The rotation is not caused solely by the direct interaction between the electric field and the metal rod. The primary cause is **ion wind** (or electric wind), where the strong electric field ionizes air molecules near the rod's tips. These ions are then repelled by the field, creating a reaction force (thrust) that pushes back on the rod, causing it to rotate."
0291-7,C
0292-0,"**Answer:** 0
**Explanation:** Based on the video footage, as the bus passes the camera, there are no vehicles visible directly following it in the same lane."
0292-1,"**1**

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows one red car following the bus at approximately the 0:06 mark, just before the long exposure shot is displayed."
0292-2,"**No.**

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows a red car passing the camera's position around the 0:06 mark, immediately after the bus has passed."
0292-3,"**No.**

The light trails immediately behind the bus appear consistent with a single vehicle, as there aren't two distinct sets of headlight/taillight trails clearly visible directly following it in the long exposure shot."
0292-7,B
0295-0,"**Two methods:**

The person first tried to pour the sauce into the squeeze bottle while the dispensing cap/nozzle was still on. After the woman removed the cap, they tried a second time, pouring into the wider opening of the bottle."
0295-1,"**One technique.**

The person consistently used the technique of pouring/squeezing the contents from the large yellow bag into the smaller yellow squeeze bottle. Although they made two attempts (the first failing due to the cap being on), the method used remained the same."
0295-2,"**Yes.**

**Explanation:** The person first attempted to pour the contents from the yellow bag into the small nozzle of the bottle. After the cap was removed by another person, they then poured the contents directly into the larger, open neck of the bottle."
0295-3,"No, the person with the yellow bag did not try three methods. They first attempted to pour the contents while the cap was still on the bottle, and then tried again after the other person removed the cap. This constitutes only two attempts or methods shown in the video."
0295-7,B
0296-0,"The man doesn't catch the blue pants on his first attempt because they were replaced with tiny pants using a visual effect or editing trick just as he reached for them. The original, large pants were removed from the scene digitally or through a quick cut, and the miniature version was substituted in their place as part of a planned visual gag."
0296-1,The man missed catching the blue pants because they fell off the clothesline before he could secure his grip. The pants became detached from the line and dropped too quickly for him to intercept them before they hit the ground.
0296-2,"Yes, the reason the man misses the blue pants on his first attempt is due to a visual illusion.

**Explanation:** The scene uses a technique called forced perspective. The large blue pants are positioned much further away from the man and the clothesline than they appear from the camera's viewpoint. This manipulation of depth perception makes the pants look as though they are hanging on the line within the man's reach, causing him to miss when he tries to grab them at their apparent location."
0296-3,"Yes, the reason the man doesn't catch the blue pants is because they are part of a visual effect. The large hanging pants are swapped out during the action and replaced by a tiny, flat object that resembles a painted or printed miniature version, making the original large item effectively uncatchable as it disappears in the trick."

0303-0,He stops cycling by jumping off the bike after successfully landing his aerial trick and riding down the landing ramp.
0303-1,He stops by dismounting the bike while it is still moving slightly and letting it fall onto its side. He then runs a few steps to stop his own forward momentum.
0303-2,**No.** The man successfully lands his aerial trick on the large inflatable cushion (landing ramp) while still on his bike. He then rides off the cushion before getting off his bike to celebrate; he does not crash into the cushion to stop.
0303-3,"Yes, after landing the trick, the man stops the bike, dismounts, lets the bike fall, and walks/runs away celebrating."
0303-7,C
0304-0,"**Answer:** Two layers of paper.

**Explanation:** The video shows the person writing along a horizontal line. The characters are written such that the top part is on the visible top layer of paper and the bottom part is written on a second layer of paper positioned underneath. This is confirmed when the top layer is lifted to reveal the complete message ""I Love you"", formed by combining the writing on both layers."
0304-1,"**One sheet:** The person starts writing the equation ""128√e980"" on the top portion of a single sheet of paper. This top portion is then lifted to reveal that the equation cleverly forms the top halves of the letters spelling ""I Love you"" on the bottom portion of the same sheet."
0304-2,"Yes, the person initially writes on two layers of paper.

**Explanation:** The writing is done across two separate pieces of paper aligned along the horizontal line. The top halves of the characters are on the upper layer, and the bottom halves are on the lower layer. This allows the message ""I Love you"" to be revealed when the top layer is lifted."
0304-3,"No, the person does not initially write on just one layer of paper. They are writing across two layers simultaneously (or one layer partially covered by another strip), with the top half of the equation on the top layer/strip and the bottom half on the layer underneath, allowing the hidden message ""I Love you"" to be revealed when the top layer/strip is removed."

0308-0,"The first military aircraft is performing a low pass or aborted landing approach towards the aircraft carrier, followed by pulling up sharply into a steep climb away from the deck. This maneuver is often referred to as a wave-off, bolter, or go-around in the context of carrier operations."
0308-1,"The initial military aircraft is **attempting to land on the aircraft carrier**. It is making its final approach, descending towards the flight deck and aligning itself for recovery."
0308-2,"Yes, the aircraft appears to be performing a ""bolter"" or a ""wave-off,"" where it aborts the landing attempt on the aircraft carrier and goes around for another try. The sharp pull-up maneuver indicates it did not successfully catch the arresting gear or was instructed to abort."
0308-3,"No, the first military aircraft is not taking off from the aircraft carrier; it is flying over the carrier deck."
0308-7,B
0313-0,"**Answer:** 7 compartments.
**Explanation:** At the end of the video, the products are displayed in the three top compartments, the three middle compartments, and the leftmost bottom compartment, totaling 7 compartments."
0313-1,"**9**

**Explanation:** By the end of the video, all nine visible cube sections of the white shelf unit are filled with various products."
0313-2,"Yes, the products occupy 9 compartments on the shelf at the end of the video. The final shot clearly shows the fully arranged 3x3 shelf with products placed in every compartment."
0313-3,"**No**

**Explanation:** At the end of the video, the products are displayed within the 9 white cube compartments of the shelving unit, arranged in a 3x3 grid. The bottom row contains storage bins, not products displayed in the white shelf compartments. Therefore, only 9 compartments are occupied by the products shown."
0313-7,B
0319-0,"**Along path C:** The ball follows path C. According to Newton's First Law (inertia), once the ball exits the constraining ring, it continues to move in a straight line tangent to the circular path it was following. Path C represents this tangential, straight-line motion."
0319-1,"The ball follows path **C**.

**Explanation:** According to Newton's first law (inertia), once the ball leaves the constraint of the circular track, the centripetal force keeping it in a circle is removed. The ball then continues to move in a straight line in the direction of its velocity at the moment it exited, which is tangent to the circular path. Path C represents this straight tangential trajectory."
0319-2,"**No.**
Explanation: The ball follows path C after exiting the ring due to inertia, continuing in a straight line tangent to its circular path at the point of exit. However, the video ends after the person picks up the ball, and does not show the ball being put back into the circular wooden piece."
0319-3,"No, the ball does not end up at position A. The video shows the ball follows path C because once it leaves the constraint of the circular track, its inertia causes it to continue moving in a straight line tangent to the circle at the point of exit."
0319-7,D
0320-0,"He performs a backflip over the low yellow bar, tucking his knees during the backward rotation and landing in the sand."
0320-1,"**Action:** Backflip / Tuck Backflip

**Explanation:** The person jumps and performs a backward rotational flip (somersault) over the horizontal bar, tucking their knees towards their chest during the rotation."
0320-2,"No, the person in the last clip performs a backflip off a yellow horizontal bar, landing in the sand near the tire. He does not stand on a pole or jump onto the tire."
0320-3,"No. The last person shown performs a backflip over a low horizontal bar on a sandy playground, not a fence."
0320-7,E
0321-0,"**Answer:** The group is creating a social media video by performing a coordinated hand gesture trend, synchronizing their movements (fist, peace sign, finger heart) to music while filming from a low angle.

**Explanation:** This activity combines several elements described: it's clearly being filmed for social media (3, 10, 28), involves coordinated hand gestures performed in a circle (1, 2, 18), follows a specific sequence often seen in online trends or challenges (4, 11, 12, 15, 21, 27, 32), and the movements are synchronized to the background music (6, 7, 24). The low-angle shot (8) and eventual reveal of their faces (26) are typical of this style of content creation."
0321-1,"**Activity:** Making coordinated hand gestures in a sequence.

**Explanation:** The group forms a circle and performs synchronized hand movements, changing their hand shapes together (from fist to peace sign, back to fist, then to finger heart) following a specific pattern against the sky, likely as a team bonding activity or while filming content."
0321-2,"Yes, the people in the group are filming a video with hand gesture choreography. Their hands perform a synchronized sequence of gestures (fists, peace signs, finger hearts) in unison, indicating a planned routine for a video recording."
0321-3,"**No.**

The people in the video are not playing rock, paper, scissors. Although they use the 'rock' (fist) and 'scissors' (V-sign) hand gestures, the 'paper' (open hand) gesture is missing. Furthermore, the hand movements appear coordinated and sequential rather than the simultaneous reveal required for the actual game. The sequence ends with a finger heart gesture, which is unrelated to the game."
0321-7,A
0325-0,"The rider jumps **7** times over distinct obstacles/ramps in the main sequence and performs **3** flips during those jumps.

**Explanation:**
*   **Jumps:** Counting each time the rider becomes airborne launching off a ramp or drop feature in the main course line (excluding the final quarter pipe trick) results in 7 jumps.
*   **Flips:** Counting the maneuvers involving a full upside-down rotation (like backflips, front flips, and potentially specific variations like the first cashroll shown) results in 3 flips during the 7 jumps."
0325-1,"The rider performs **8 jumps** and **5 flips**.

**Explanation:**

*   **Jumps:** The rider takes off from a ramp or obstacle 8 separate times.
*   **Flips:** During those jumps, the rider executes 5 maneuvers involving a full rotation (flip), including variations like cashrolls, backflips, front flips, and flairs."
0325-2,"**False.** The rider performed 8 distinct jumps/aerial maneuvers, but only 2 of these involved flips."
0325-3,"No, the rider performed significantly more than three flips and jumps while crossing the obstacles. The video shows a full run with numerous aerial tricks executed over various ramps."
0325-7,B
0334-0,"The scene that is NOT taken in real life is the **Pencil erasing roads**.

**Explanation:** This image depicts a giant pencil eraser creating a path through a maze of roads for a person. This is physically impossible and represents a conceptual illustration or digital manipulation, unlike the other scenes which use forced perspective photography techniques."
0334-1,"Based on the analysis, all the scenes listed utilize techniques like forced perspective, digital manipulation, or represent conceptual ideas, and therefore do not depict straightforward, naturally occurring real-life situations as they appear:

1.  **0:00 - Water bottle pouring upwards:** Water appears to defy gravity.
2.  **0:01 - Scissor handles framing bridge:** Forced perspective creates an illusion.
3.  **0:03 - Key framing arch:** Forced perspective creates an illusion.
4.  **0:05 - Hanger 'holding' bridge:** Forced perspective creates an illusion.
5.  **0:07 - Highlighters as buildings:** Forced perspective creates an illusion.
6.  **0:09 - Eating the sun:** Forced perspective creates an illusion.
7.  **0:11 - Pencil erasing roads:** Conceptual digital manipulation.
8.  **0:13 - Whisk as a birdcage:** Forced perspective or digital manipulation creates an illusion."
0334-2,"**Yes**, the scene with the pencil erasing the road is a digitally created image.

**Explanation:** The image depicts a physically impossible scenario. A pencil eraser cannot erase actual roads, and the scale of the pencil relative to the landscape and the person is unrealistic. This type of visual metaphor, showing a complex path being cleared, is achieved through digital manipulation or graphic design software."
0334-3,"**Answer:** No
**Explanation:** This scene is not real. It is a creative photograph using either digital manipulation (compositing the birds into the whisk) or forced perspective (aligning the whisk with birds far in the background). The birds are not actually inside the whisk."

**Explanation:** The main wall of the dam structure has four distinct rectangular openings built into it, separated by vertical brick pillars (visible from 0:17 onwards), designed to allow water to flow through as the primary drainage channels."
0340-1,"**5**

**Explanation:** The video shows the construction of a small dam with **four** main rectangular drainage openings built into the wall (clearly visible from 0:17 onwards) and **one** additional overflow spillway channel dug into the side bank (visible from 0:52 onwards), making a total of five distinct drainage channels in the final structure."
0340-2,"Yes, it is true that there are four drainage channels visible in the video. The man constructs the dam wall leaving four distinct openings (outlets) and builds four corresponding channels on the sloped spillway below these openings."
0340-3,"No, there are not five drainage channels shown in the video. The video clearly shows the construction and final structure featuring four distinct, parallel drainage channels built on the downstream side of the dam wall, corresponding to the four outlets."

0357-0,"He is **amused and finds the situation funny, laughing at his misfortune.**

**Explanation:** The man bursts into loud laughter immediately upon pulling out the pickle, holding it up for others to see. Given that others pulled out items like money and a phone, receiving a pickle is clearly an undesirable or ""booby"" prize in this context. His laughter indicates he finds the absurdity and his own bad luck in the game humorous, rather than showing genuine disappointment or anger."
0357-1,"The man in the white T-shirt feels **shock, disgust, and amusement**.

**Explanation:** His initial facial expression (wide eyes, open mouth) shows clear shock and surprise at pulling out a pickle. This is quickly followed by loud laughter, indicating he finds the unexpected and absurd nature of finding a pickle amusing, likely mixed with a sense of disgust or revulsion at the undesirable item."
0357-2,"**Answer:** No

**Explanation:** The man in the white T-shirt reacts with loud, open-mouthed laughter when he pulls a pickle out of the dissolved cotton candy, throwing his head back. This expression is one of amusement and surprise, not a subtle, wry smile or disappointment."
0357-3,"**Answer:** No, the man in the white T-shirt did not seem satisfied and happy in the sense of winning a prize.

**Explanation:** He dissolved his pink cotton candy to reveal a green pickle. While he laughed heartily, his reaction, along with the reactions of those around him, suggests amusement at the unexpected and likely undesirable item (compared to the money and phone found by others), rather than satisfaction with winning a valuable prize."

0358-0,"The woman in white didn't fall because, unlike the men before her, she was not physically pushed or kicked off the ledge. When the man approached her and asked ""What about you?"", she explicitly refused both verbally (saying ""不行不行"" - No, no) and non-verbally (shaking her head). The man respected her refusal and decided to perform a backflip himself instead of forcing her onto the trampoline."
0358-1,"The woman in white was prevented from falling onto the trampoline because when the man asked her if she wanted to go (""What about you?""), she explicitly refused by saying ""No, no"" (不行不行), and he respected her refusal and did not push her."
0358-2,"**Yes.** The woman in white avoided falling onto the trampoline because the man did not push her. After pushing the three men, the video shows him asking the woman if she wanted to go. She declined (saying ""不行不行"" - ""no, no""), and he respected her choice, deciding instead to perform a backflip himself."
0358-3,"No, the woman in white did not jump off herself. She remained seated on the platform after refusing to jump, and the man who had pushed the others performed a jump instead."

0368-0,"**10 scenarios.**

Explanation: The video shows ten distinct situations, each comparing how an adult performs an action versus how a toddler (portrayed by the same man) performs the same action. These situations are: eating a snack, responding to a request, napping, reacting to someone showering, eating breakfast, watching a show, cleaning up, behavior after a baby falls asleep, giving an item, and playing with toys."
0368-1,"**10**

**Explanation:** The video demonstrates ten different scenarios, each comparing how an adult performs an action versus how a toddler performs the same or a similar action. These scenarios are: eating a snack, being asked to do something, napping, reacting to someone showering, eating breakfast, watching a show, cleaning up, behaving after a baby falls asleep, giving something to someone, and playing with toys."
0368-2,"Yes, the man showed ten distinct scenarios comparing adult and toddler behavior. Each scenario presents a situation (like eating a snack, cleaning up, napping, etc.) and contrasts how an adult typically behaves versus how a toddler might behave in that same situation."
0368-3,"No, the video shows more than six scenarios.

Explanation: By counting each distinct comparison (snacking, being asked to do something, napping, showering, breakfast, watching a show, cleaning up, after baby sleeps, giving an item, playing with toys), there are ten scenarios shown, not six."

0370-0,"**3**

**Explanation:** At the beginning of the video (0:00), there are three girls positioned in the front row, each holding a sword at their left hip."
0370-1,"**3**

**Explanation:** At the very start of the video (00:00), there are three girls positioned in the front row who are clearly visible holding swords at their left hips."
0370-2,"**Answer:** No, there are three girls holding swords at the beginning of the video.
**Explanation:** At the 0:00 mark, the front row clearly shows three girls dressed in green shirts, black skirts, and white boots, each holding a sword."
0370-3,"**Yes.** At the beginning of the video (0:00), the three girls positioned in the front row are the only performers visibly holding swords."
0370-7,A
0372-0,"**Answer:** She hangs on the rim, catches the ball thrown by the boy, and dunks it.

**Explanation:** At the end of the video, after being lifted by the boy and jumping to grab the rim, the girl catches the basketball he throws to her and forcefully pushes it down through the hoop while still hanging."
0372-1,"At the conclusion of the video, the girl catches an alley-oop pass from the boy while hanging from the basketball rim and dunks the ball."
0372-2,"Yes, the girl pretends to dunk the basketball by hanging on the rim with both hands at the end of the video as the ball goes through the hoop."
0372-3,"Yes, the girl dunks the basketball. The boy lifts her up, she hangs from the rim, and after he throws the ball up to her, she pushes it down through the hoop."
0372-7,C
0374-0,"The object used appears to be the **balloon knot** (or the tied end of the balloon).

**Explanation:** The trick uses sleight of hand. The performer likely hides a separate, small piece of balloon material (often a pre-tied knot from another balloon) in their hand and makes it appear as though they are pulling the knot off the balloon they are holding before pretending to eat it."
0374-1,"The magic trick was executed using **sleight of hand** and **misdirection**. The performer likely **palmed** (hid in their hand) a small piece of red material (like candy or another piece of rubber) beforehand. When pretending to bite the balloon, they actually brought the hidden piece to their mouth, creating the illusion of having bitten off a piece of the balloon, which remained intact."
0374-2,"Yes, the magic trick in the first part of the video involved using a balloon and an extra knot. The performer appears to remove the knot, hides it (likely in their mouth or hand), blows up the balloon, and then reveals the hidden extra knot, placing it on the balloon's opening to make it look like it magically tied itself."
0374-3,"Based on the visual evidence in the first part of the video (0:00-0:09), the magic trick was **not performed by inserting or removing an object from the main body of the inflated balloon.**

**Explanation:** In both instances shown (red and yellow balloon), the performer puts a small object into their mouth *before* bringing the balloon's opening to their mouth and blowing. The video does not show an object being physically inserted into or removed from the inflated part of the balloon itself."
0374-7,B
0377-0,"It is the hand of the man sitting next to the woman on the bench.

*Explanation: The video shows the man seated to the woman's right placing his right arm around her, with his hand resting on her left shoulder.*"
0377-1,"The hand belongs to **the man sitting on the bench next to the woman**.

**Explanation:** The man is seated to the woman's right, and his right arm is positioned around her, with his hand resting on her left shoulder."
0377-2,"No, the hand on the woman's shoulder belongs to the man sitting *next* to her on the bench. The video shows him placing his arm around her shoulder before the man behind approaches and interacts with the seated man."
0377-3,"Yes, the hand on the woman's shoulder belongs to the man sitting next to her. The video clearly shows him placing his left arm around her, with his hand resting on her left shoulder."

0410-0,"After the sixth cotton candy (blue) was dissolved by the man in the grey shirt, it revealed nothing hidden inside; it was empty."
0410-1,"**Outcome:** Nothing is found inside the sixth cotton candy.

**Explanation:** The sixth person dissolves the final blue cotton candy in the bowl of water. After it dissolves completely, they reach into the water but pull their hands out empty, showing that no object was hidden inside this particular cotton candy."
0410-2,"Yes, after the sixth cotton candy dissolves, the man finds nothing in the bowl.

**Explanation:** The video shows the sixth participant (man in the grey shirt) dissolving a blue cotton candy ball in the water. After it dissolves, he reaches into the bowl and pulls his hands out empty, revealing only the blue-colored water with no hidden object."
0410-3,"**Answer:** No.

**Explanation:** A phone is revealed after the *fifth* cotton candy (pink) dissolves (around 0:34-0:37). The sixth cotton candy (blue) dissolves completely (around 0:38-0:43), revealing nothing inside the bowl."

0416-0,"The man performing the trick was surprised because the egg, which he had seemingly made vanish from his hands, was expected to reappear under the cup. However, when the spectator lifted the cup, the egg was not there, indicating the trick did not conclude as planned or intended, leading to his surprised reaction."
0416-1,"The magician was taken aback because the egg, which had vanished from his hand, did not reappear under the cup as the trick implied it would. When the cup was lifted, the space underneath was empty, contradicting the expected outcome of the magic effect."
0416-2,"Yes, the man was surprised because after the magician made the ball vanish from his hand and implied it would reappear under the cup, the man lifted the cup and discovered the ball was not there, contrary to his expectation."
0416-3,"Yes, the man was surprised because the egg vanished from the magician's hand and was not under the cup as expected. The surprise comes from the egg's disappearance and its absence from the anticipated location under the cup."

0417-0,"The person on the left is trying hard not to laugh because his colleague on the right, while handling the large Olympic flag during a formal ceremony, was momentarily completely covered by it. The flag draped over his colleague's head and upper body, making him look comically headless or engulfed, which created an awkward and amusing visual mishap that contrasted sharply with the seriousness of the event and their military posture."
0417-1,"The person on the left is trying hard not to laugh because his colleague on the right, while handling the large Olympic flag during a formal ceremony, was momentarily completely covered by it. The flag draped over his colleague's head and upper body, making him look comically headless or engulfed, which created an awkward and amusing visual mishap that contrasted sharply with the seriousness of the event and their military posture."
0417-2,"**Answer:** Yes, the person on the left is likely trying not to laugh precisely because of the seriousness and formality of the occasion.

**Explanation:** Formal ceremonies, like the one depicted (likely related to the Beijing 2022 Olympics), demand strict composure, professionalism, and solemnity from participants, especially those in uniform. While the preceding incident where the flag covered the other person's head could be seen as awkward or humorous, laughing would break the required decorum. Therefore, the seriousness of the event necessitates suppressing any such reaction to maintain military bearing and respect for the occasion."
0417-3,"**No.** The person on the left is likely trying not to laugh because of the humorous visual of the flag temporarily covering the head of the person on the right, not because of an unresolved problem."
0417-7,C
0420-0,"**Answer:** No, we cannot determine if the cat won.

**Explanation:** The video shows the cat choosing a hand by tapping it, but it ends before the person opens their fist to reveal whether the treat was actually in that hand. Therefore, we don't know if the cat's guess was correct."
0420-1,"Based on the video and the provided answers:

It is impossible to determine if the cat succeeded in the 'which hand' game. The cat clearly chose a hand by tapping the person's left fist, but the video cuts off before the person opens their hand to reveal whether the treat was inside. Therefore, the outcome remains unknown."
0420-2,"**Answer:** No, it cannot be determined from the video if the cat won.

**Explanation:** The video shows the cat choosing a hand by tapping it, but the clip ends before the person opens their hand to reveal whether the treat was inside. Therefore, the outcome of the game is unknown."
0420-3,"**Answer:** No, we cannot determine if the cat lost the game.

**Explanation:** The video ends immediately after the cat makes its choice by tapping one of the hands. It doesn't show whether the chosen hand actually contained the treat or not, so the outcome of the game (whether the cat won or lost) is unknown."
0420-7,B
0427-0,"The man achieved the trick using a mirror and an assistant.

**Explanation:**
He placed the bottom half of a pre-cut watermelon onto a mirror lying flat on the table. The mirror's reflection created the illusion of a whole watermelon. When he made the cutting motion and lifted his half, an assistant (Deborah Ann) quickly placed the other real half onto the mirror where the reflection had been, completing the illusion."
0427-1,"The man used a mirror placed horizontally on the table. He held one half of a pre-cut watermelon above the mirror. The reflection of this half in the mirror created the optical illusion of a whole watermelon. When he pretended to cut it, an assistant quickly handed him the other pre-cut half."
0427-2,"Yes, the illusion of taking out a whole watermelon is created, but it's achieved using a practical effect (a mirror), not primarily video editing for the illusion itself.
Explanation: A mirror is placed flat on the table. The bottom half of the cut watermelon rests on the mirror. The mirror reflects this bottom half, creating the appearance of a whole watermelon when viewed from the front, especially when the real top half is lifted away."
0427-3,"Yes, the trick is achieved using a prop where a hollowed-out watermelon rind contains a separate, pre-peeled watermelon half (or a realistic model), which is revealed when the top rind shell is lifted after the fake cut."
0427-7,A
0430-0,"The damage to the phone is caused by **severe electrical overload and subsequent extreme overheating**.

*   **Explanation:** The hand-crank device acts as an unregulated generator, producing unstable and excessive voltage and/or current far beyond what the phone's charging circuitry and battery are designed to handle. This electrical overload causes components to heat up incredibly rapidly (Joule heating/thermal runaway). The intense heat creates significant thermal stress and potentially causes components like the battery to swell, exerting physical pressure. This combination of extreme heat and physical stress leads to the catastrophic failure observed, including the cracked screen and smoke."
0430-1,"**Answer:** Turning the crank on the blue device led to the phone appearing damaged.

**Explanation:** The video shows a person turning the crank on a blue, hand-powered device connected to the phone via a charging cable. Immediately after cranking, the phone's screen displays an impossibly fast charging rate followed by visual effects depicting the screen shattering and emitting smoke. While the effect is clearly simulated (especially confirmed when a second, fake phone is used), the action of turning the crank is presented as the direct cause within the video's narrative."
0430-2,"Yes, the phone's damage was a result of video editing effects.

The charging speed shown (reaching thousands of percent in seconds) is physically impossible for a hand-crank charger. Additionally, the way the screen instantly shatters with a smoke effect is a typical visual effect, not a realistic outcome of electrical damage from such a low-power source. The video later confirms this by showing the second ""damaged"" phone was actually a fake prop."
0430-3,"**No.**

The phone damage shown is a visual effect. Hand-crank chargers produce very low power, insufficient to overcharge a phone or cause the rapid, catastrophic damage depicted. The impossible charging percentages (reaching thousands of percent in seconds) and the reveal of a ""FAKE"" sticker on a similar phone later in the video confirm the event was staged using special effects for entertainment."
0430-7,C
0432-0,"**Answer:** The last few targets come from the hand-held orange clay target thrower operated by the woman standing next to the shooter.

**Explanation:** Throughout the video, the woman consistently uses the orange manual thrower in her hand to launch each orange clay target into the air for the man to shoot. This method is used for all targets shown, including the last few."
0432-1,"**Answer:** The last few targets are multiple dark-colored clay pigeons (or clay targets).

**Explanation:** After shooting the initial target which explodes with pink powder, the shooter rapidly fires at several subsequent targets launched into the air. These targets appear as dark-colored discs against the sky and break apart when hit, consistent with standard clay pigeons used in this type of shooting sport."
0432-2,"Yes, the last few targets in the video are spent shotgun shell casings (often called hulls) thrown by the man himself. After shooting the initial clay target launched by the woman, he proceeds to toss the empty casings into the air and shoot them as a demonstration of skill."
0432-3,"**Answer:** No, the last targets were likely not thrown by the person next to the shooter.

**Explanation:** The rapid succession of shots towards the end of the video makes it highly improbable that the woman standing next to the shooter could have manually thrown each target that quickly. It's much more likely those targets were launched by an automatic or semi-automatic trap machine located elsewhere on the range. While she holds a hand thrower earlier, she doesn't appear to be using it during the final rapid-fire sequence."
0432-7,B
0435-0,"**Answer:**

All three swings cut the target:

1.  **First swing (0:01-0:02):** An upward diagonal cut severs the top bundle.
2.  **Second swing (0:06-0:07):** A downward diagonal cut severs the second bundle.
3.  **Third swing (0:08-0:09):** A horizontal cut severs the third bundle."
0435-1,"All three sword swings shown in the video successfully hit the straw mat target.

*   The first swing (upward diagonal cut while kneeling) successfully hit the top section.
*   The second swing (downward diagonal cut after standing) successfully cut the second section.
*   The third swing (horizontal cut) successfully cut the third section."
0435-2,"Yes, the man's first sword swing hit the target. The video clearly shows the sword making contact with the topmost bundle of straw at 0:02, slicing through it and sending pieces of straw flying."
0435-3,"Yes, the man's sword cut through a section of the straw mat target with every swing shown. The video clearly depicts four swings, and each swing successfully severs one of the four straw bundles, causing it to fall from the stand."
0435-7,C
0439-0,"The man lights **a bundle of matches**.

**Explanation:** The video shows a collection of blue matchsticks held upright together in a holder, and the man ignites their flammable tips simultaneously, creating a single large flame from the bundle."
0439-1,"The man ignites **a bundle/cluster of candles**.

**Explanation:** The object clearly consists of multiple small, blue, candle-like items grouped together on a base, with their wicks lit to produce a large flame."
0439-2,"No, the man does not light the pile of thin candles (or matches) in the video. The items are already burning brightly with a large flame from the very beginning of the clip."
0439-3,"Yes, the object is lit and resembles a stack of matches. The blue cylindrical object in the tray has multiple points on top that are burning with a large flame, consistent with the appearance of a bundle of lit matches."
0439-7,B
0441-0,"**Answer:** Both legs are alternating in a high-knee running motion, each cycling through flexion (lifting high) and extension (pushing off).

**Explanation:** Throughout the run, the man's legs move reciprocally; as one leg drives the knee high towards the chest (flexion), the other leg extends powerfully to push off the ground and propel him forward before swinging through to repeat the high-knee lift."
0441-1,"**Answer:** The man's legs are **muscular**, **strong**, and appear to be **straining** or **under load**.

**Explanation:** The video shows his legs, particularly the thighs, are visibly muscular and defined. They appear strong as they support and propel his large upper body during the run. His running form suggests his legs are working hard or straining under the load of his physique."
0441-2,"He is staying in the same spot. The first clip shows a close-up making it look like he might be running forward, but the second clip reveals from a wider angle that he is running in place."
0441-3,"**Yes**, the man's running style, particularly evident in the second clip (""What they see""), clearly involves lifting his knees very high with each stride and maintaining a pronounced forward lean or thrust of his upper body."
0441-7,C
0452-0,"**Left Leg:** Characterized by agility, intricate footwork close to the ground, and often serving as a pivot point.
*Explanation: The dancer uses the left leg for quick, complex steps low to the ground and frequently rotates around it.*

**Right Leg:** Characterized by power, extension, and wider, sweeping or kicking motions, often acting as the driving force for dynamic movements.
*Explanation: The dancer uses the right leg for more forceful actions like kicks, leg swings, and pushing off for momentum.*"
0452-1,"Both the dancer's left and right legs appear healthy, athletic, and fully functional. They demonstrate significant strength, agility, coordination, and flexibility, allowing the dancer to perform complex breakdancing moves without any visible impairment or limitation in either leg."
0452-2,"**No.** The dancer actively uses both legs for complex breakdancing moves, demonstrating strength, coordination, and weight-bearing ability in the left leg. There is no visual evidence to suggest the left leg is disabled; both legs appear healthy and are used skillfully throughout the routine."
0452-3,"**Answer:** Yes, somewhat.
**Explanation:** The dancer's left leg is frequently involved in quick, agile footwork, while the right leg often provides powerful support or push-offs. However, this isn't exclusive, as both legs are used dynamically for the complex breakdancing moves, contributing to both agility and power throughout the routine."
0452-7,D
0456-0,"**Answer:** 7 nails.
**Explanation:** The man places 4 rusty nails into the left mug and 3 rusty nails into the right mug at the beginning of the experiment. He shows these same 7 nails after cleaning them at the end."
0456-1,"**7 nails**

**Explanation:** The man places 4 rusty nails into the left mug and 3 rusty nails into the right mug at the beginning of the experiment (0:01-0:03)."
0456-2,"Yes, the man used six railroad spikes (which function as large nails in this context), placing three in each of the two glass mugs. This is visible from 0:01 to 0:03 in the video."
0456-3,"**No.**

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows the man placing 3 large, rusty railroad spikes into each of the two mugs, making a total of 6 spikes used in the experiment, not 14 nails (7 in each). This is confirmed when he pours the liquids out and displays the 3 cleaned spikes from each mug at the end."
0456-7,D
0463-0,"**Answer:** The first throw.
**Explanation:** The basket counter graphic with five empty circles appears on screen around the 0:07 mark. The very next action is the man attempting his first throw (around 0:08), and the result of this throw (a miss) is immediately recorded as the first red 'X' on the counter at 0:10. Therefore, the counting begins with this initial throw attempt."
0463-1,"The counter begins to count from the **First Throw**.

**Explanation:** The ""BASKET COUNTER"" graphic with five empty circles appears on screen just before the man takes his first shot (around the 0:07 mark). The result of this very first throw (a miss) is immediately recorded by changing the first circle to a red 'X'."
0463-2,"No, the counter starts counting from the very first throw shown in the video, marking it as a miss with a red 'X'."
0463-3,"No, the counter tracks every attempt shown in the sequence, starting from the first throw after the counter graphic appears. It marks misses with a red X and successful baskets with a green checkmark."
0463-7,D
0466-0,"There are **7** images shown in the video that feature optical illusions, clever perspectives, or time-freezing moments.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Man on Broom:** Forced perspective/timed jump.
2.  **Giant Seagull:** Forced perspective.
3.  **Airplane & Sun:** Perfect timing/perspective.
4.  **Ant & Twig:** Perspective making the ant seem strong.
5.  **Feeding the Sun:** Forced perspective.
6.  **Bird Dolphin:** Perfect timing capturing a natural phenomenon (murmuration).
7.  **Statue of Liberty & Contrail:** Perfect timing/perspective."
0466-1,"There are **7** images featuring optical illusions in the video.

**Explanation:** Each image shown uses techniques like forced perspective (man on broom, giant seagull, ant lifting twig, feeding the sun), perfect timing (airplane 'cat ears' on the sun, Statue of Liberty contrail), or pareidolia (bird murmuration forming a dolphin shape) to create a visual effect that tricks the eye or appears different from reality."
0466-2,"Yes, the video contains images related to optical illusions.

**Explanation:** The video displays 7 images, all of which utilize techniques such as forced perspective, perfectly timed photography, or pareidolia to create visual effects that trick the eye or play with perception."
0466-3,"**Answer:** No

**Explanation:** The video contains 7 distinct images, all of which are examples of optical illusions created through techniques like forced perspective, perfect timing, or pareidolia. Since there are 7 such images, not 5, the statement is incorrect."
0466-7,D
0468-0,"**Answer:** The second person shown in the video successfully walked down the stairs.

**Explanation:** The video shows two attempts. The first person (wearing patterned socks on grey carpet) stumbles and falls. The second person (wearing black socks on lighter carpet), shown starting around the 9-second mark, successfully navigates the stairs with the visual effect and reaches the bottom without falling."
0468-1,"The second person shown in the video, who is wearing black socks and walking on the lighter-colored carpeted stairs, was able to walk down successfully."
0468-2,"**Yes.**

The second person is shown successfully walking down several steps of the staircase while the whirlpool effect is active, maintaining their balance and making clear downward progress without falling during the clip."
0468-3,"**Answer:** No, the first person did not successfully walk down the stairs.

**Explanation:** The video shows the first person stumbling significantly around the 7-second mark, followed by an abrupt cut and a sound suggesting they fell. We do not see them recover or continue walking down successfully."
0468-7,B
0494-0,"**One** kind of scissors was used.

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows only a single pair of scissors, identifiable by their black handles and standard metal blades, being used to cut the paper spiral."
0494-1,"**Answer:** 1
**Explanation:** The video clearly shows only one pair of scissors being used to cut the paper spiral."
0494-2,"**No.** Only one type of scissors (standard metal scissors with black handles) is shown being used to cut the paper spiral at the beginning of the video. Later, a different tool, which appears to be pliers or tweezers, is used to handle a needle."
0494-3,"No, only one kind of scissors was used in the video. The video shows a single pair of scissors with black handles cutting the paper spiral at the beginning."
0494-7,C
0500-0,"There are **3** ping-pong balls shown in the video.

*   **Explanation:** A white ping-pong ball appears at 0:11, an orange ping-pong ball appears at 0:13, and another orange ping-pong ball appears at 0:21."
0500-1,"**Answer:** 3
**Explanation:** The video shows three separate clips featuring ping-pong balls: one white ball hit between candles (0:10-0:12), one orange ball landing on a dart (0:12-0:16), and another orange ball used in a bottle/tile trick (0:20-0:23)."
0500-2,"Yes, three ping-pong balls are featured in the video. One white ball is used to extinguish candles (0:11), and two separate orange balls are used in subsequent tricks involving a dart (0:13) and a bottle (0:21)."
0500-3,"No, there are only three ping-pong balls shown in the video.

**Explanation:** The man in the purple shirt is carrying a tray with a plate, and there are clearly 5 dumplings arranged in a row on that plate."
0501-1,"**5**

There are 5 dumplings visible on the plate the man in the purple shirt is carrying and places on the table."
0501-2,"**No, the man in purple has 6 soup dumplings on his plate.** A visual count of the dumplings on the plate he is carrying confirms there are six."
0501-3,"Yes, the man in purple has 6 dumplings on his plate. Counting the items on the black tray he carries and sets down confirms there are six individual dumplings."
0501-7,C
0512-0,"**4 pots.**

**Explanation:** At the beginning of the video, after rolling off the metal ramp, the ping-pong ball bounces sequentially off the inverted bottoms of four distinct black pots."
0512-1,"**Answer:** 3 pots.
**Explanation:** The video clearly shows the ping-pong ball bouncing off the bottom of three separate inverted pots consecutively after rolling off the initial ramp."
0512-2,"No, the ping-pong ball did not hit seven pots. It only bounced off four pots at the start of the Rube Goldberg machine."
0512-3,"No, the ping-pong ball did not hit only two pots. It bounced off the bottom of four different pots arranged in sequence at the beginning of the video."
0512-7,E
0520-0,"The letters **I, V, and W** require the minimum number of people (one person each) to make up in the video."
0520-1,"The letters requiring the fewest people to form are **I, V, and W**.

**Explanation:** As observed in the video, the letters I, V, and W are each formed by only one person. All other letters in the sequence require either two or three people to create the shape."
0520-2,"Yes, the letters 'I,' 'V,' and 'W' each require only one person to form in the video. The letter 'I' is formed by one standing person (00:18), 'V' by one person in a seated V-pose (00:47), and 'W' by one person lying down with limbs spread (00:49)."
0520-3,"No, 'I' is not the only letter formed by the minimum number of people. The minimum number is one person, and letters 'V' and 'W' are also formed by a single person."

0526-0,**Two.** The man is holding two items that function as lighters: a standard orange lighter in one hand and a blue lighter disguised as a pen in the other hand. Both are shown producing a flame.
0526-1,"**2**

**Explanation:** The man is holding one orange lighter in his left hand and one blue lighter (which appears to be a torch lighter) in his right hand."
0526-2,"Yes, the man is holding two lighters in his hands in the second video.

**Explanation:** The object in his left hand is a standard orange disposable lighter. The object in his right hand, although shaped like a pen, also produces a flame when ignited by the first lighter, confirming it is also a type of lighter (often called a pen lighter or torch lighter)."
0526-3,**No.** The man is holding two lighters in the second video clip: one standard orange lighter in his left hand and one blue torch-style lighter in his right hand.
0526-7,B
0530-0,"**The middle ball:** The man in blue kicked the soccer ball positioned in the middle of the three, which was being held up by the kneeling man."
0530-1,"The man in blue kicked the ball positioned on the right side from his perspective, which was also held lower by the kneeling man."
0530-2,"No, the man in blue kicked the leftmost ball, not the middle one."
0530-3,"**Answer:** No, the man in blue did not kick the top ball.

**Explanation:** The scene where the man in blue kicks a soccer ball is the sixth scene (00:10-00:11), not the fifth. In that scene, he clearly kicks the bottom soccer ball resting on the grass, while the kneeling man holds the top ball steady."
0530-7,B
0539-0,"**Answer:** 5

**Explanation:** There are four pedestrians on the sidewalk (0:06-0:10) and one woman standing outside a mail truck (0:58-1:00) who are visibly scared by the masked person."
0539-1,"**5**

**Explanation:** The video shows a group of four pedestrians walking on the sidewalk who scream and run away, and later a mail carrier standing next to her truck who screams and jumps back. Both incidents involve individuals outside of a car reacting with fright."

0541-0,"**12**
The drawing in the video clearly shows 6 teeth on the top row and 6 teeth on the bottom row, totaling 12 teeth."
0541-1,"**10**

**Explanation:** The drawing consistently shows 5 teeth on the upper row and 5 teeth on the lower row, making a total of 10 teeth visible throughout the video."
0541-2,"Yes, there are consistently 10 teeth visible in the video. The drawing inside the plastic bag changes appearance when lifted (showing clean teeth) and lowered (showing dirty teeth), but the number of teeth depicted remains 10 throughout the process."
0541-3,"**No**, the number of visible teeth does not decrease to none.

**Explanation:** The outlines defining the teeth remain clearly visible throughout the video, even when the drawing is submerged in water. The optical effect caused by the water makes the black spots *on* the teeth disappear, creating the illusion of them being cleaned, but it does not make the teeth outlines themselves vanish."
0541-7,D
0542-0,"The scene shown as a metaphor for time passage is **the person sitting under the waterfall**.

**Explanation:** This brief scene is inserted between the moment the coals are placed on the pan lid (starting the baking) and the moment they are removed (ending the baking), visually representing the time that elapsed while the bread cooked."
0542-1,**0:49 - Wide shot of the waterfall:** This tranquil shot of the waterfall and the surrounding nature is inserted between placing the coals on the pan lid (0:48) and removing them (0:50). Such scenic interludes are commonly used in editing to indicate that time has passed while an action (like cooking) takes place off-screen. The flowing water itself can be seen as a metaphor for the passage of time.
0542-2,"Yes, the scene where the person is sitting under the waterfall is used to represent the passage of time while the stromboli cooks. The editing places this tranquil scene directly between the actions of setting the stromboli to bake over the campfire (including placing coals on the lid) and removing it after it has cooked, clearly indicating that this interlude represents the cooking duration."
0542-3,"Yes, the scene is placed exactly during the cooking time (between covering the pan and uncovering it), suggesting it represents the waiting period. It functions as a visual pause or cutaway, a common technique in visual storytelling to denote a lapse in time for an ongoing process like baking."
0542-7,D
0548-0,"The second thing the man clips with the car window is a **cucumber**.

**Explanation:** In the video segment around the 0:08-0:09 mark, the man first holds up a hotdog/sausage which gets clipped by the window. Immediately after, he holds up a cucumber, which is the second item to be clipped by the window."
0548-1,"**Cucumber:** The video first shows the man closing the window on a pink sausage, then a green cucumber, and finally an orange carrot. Therefore, the cucumber is the second item."
0548-2,"Yes, the man clipped the cucumber with the car window after the sausage. In the video segment around 0:08-0:09, the man first holds up a sausage which gets clipped by the closing window, and immediately after, he holds up a cucumber which also gets clipped by the window."
0548-3,"**Answer:** No.
**Explanation:** The man first clips a hotdog, then a cucumber, and finally a carrot with the car window. The carrot is the third item, not the second."

**Explanation:** In the scene where the woman is kneeling (around 0:12-0:17), a double light switch plate is visible on the wall behind her. Both individual toggle switches on this plate are clearly in the lower, or 'down', position."
0551-1,"The switches are positioned **on the wall to the right of the door frame, between the door and a large brown cabinet.**

**Explanation:** In the scene where the woman is kneeling (around 0:12), a standard white, vertically oriented switch plate is clearly visible on the wall. It is located immediately to the right of the door frame and occupies the wall space before the tall brown cabinet/wardrobe."
0551-2,**No.** The light switch remains in the same position (down) throughout the scene where the woman is kneeling by the bucket.
0551-3,"Yes, both switches on the wall are in the same position. They are both flipped downwards."

0566-0,"Based on the visual storytelling and the overall message of the advertisement:

The scene with the broken plant pot being swept up is included as a visual metaphor. It compares the act of sweeping dry dirt, which often leaves residue and represents an incomplete cleaning job, to using only dry toilet paper. This analogy serves to highlight the perceived insufficiency of using only dry paper for personal hygiene and sets up the advertised wet wipes as the obvious solution for achieving a more thorough and complete clean."
0566-1,"The purpose of showing the broken pot of plant being swept up incompletely is to serve as a visual metaphor. It illustrates that dry cleaning methods (like sweeping, analogous to using only dry toilet paper) can be imperfect and leave residue behind, contrasting this with the thorough clean achieved by using the advertised toilet paper and wipes together."
0566-2,"Yes, the broken plant scene symbolizes the mess, and the sweeping action represents the potentially incomplete or less effective cleaning achieved with only dry toilet paper, analogous to how sweeping might not perfectly remove all fine soil particles."
0566-3,"Yes, the scenes with the broken pot plant highlight the effectiveness of Neve toilet paper and wipes by serving as a visual analogy. The ad uses the imagery of effectively cleaning the spilled soil and plant mess to represent the thorough cleaning power achieved when using Neve toilet paper and wipes together for personal hygiene."

0580-0,"**4 steps:** The girl takes four steps on the warped wall (Right, Left, Right, Left) before grabbing the top edge."
0580-1,"**4 steps.**

**Explanation:** The girl takes four distinct steps on the surface of the warped wall (right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot) before grabbing the top edge."
0580-2,"**No.** She took three steps on the wall (Right, Left, Right) before jumping to grab the top."
0580-3,"**Answer:** Yes, the girl ran five steps before reaching the top.

**Explanation:** By carefully observing the video, we can count her steps as she runs up the warped wall. Her right foot takes the first step, followed by her left, then right, then left, and finally her right foot takes the fifth step just before she leaps to grab the top edge."

0589-0,"**No**, the person in the video did not eat all the chocolate in six hours. The video footage clearly shows that at the 6-hour mark, there was still a significant amount of chocolate left in the tank."
0589-1,"**Answer:** No, the individual did not consume all the chocolate within a six-hour period.

**Explanation:** The video displays time markers, and at the ""6 hours"" point during the chocolate eating sequence, the tank is still visibly filled with a large quantity of chocolate bars. Additionally, a text overlay appears later in the video stating, ""I ate this in small batches over several days,"" confirming the consumption took much longer than six hours."
0589-2,"**Answer:** No, significantly less than half of the chocolate was left at the six-hour mark.
**Explanation:** The video shows a timestamp ""6 hours"" around the 0:07 mark. At this point, the man has eaten most of the chocolate bars, and the tank appears much less than half full."
0589-3,"No, the video does not show that it took 12 hours to finish the chocolate.

*   **Explanation:** The video shows timestamps up to 6 hours for the chocolate eating segment. The 12-hour timestamp appears at the end of the *second* challenge, which involved drinking coconut water (VitaCoco) with a fork. The text overlay confirming the 12-hour completion time appears after the person finishes drinking the coconut water, not eating the chocolate. Additionally, an English text overlay near the end states, ""I ate this [the chocolate] in small batches over several days."""

0590-1,"The man in the black jacket screamed because the man in the red sweater placed a large, fake spider directly on his face while he was lying on the floor at the bottom of the stairs. This sudden action startled him, causing him to scream out of surprise and fear."
0590-2,"Yes, the man in the black jacket screamed because the man in the red sweater placed a toy spider directly onto his face while he was lying on the floor at the bottom of the stairs. The scream occurred immediately after the toy spider made contact with his face."
0590-3,"Yes, the man in the black jacket screamed because of the spider, but not because he *stepped* on it. He screamed because the man in the red sweater placed a large, fake spider directly onto his face while he was lying on the floor after slipping."

0595-0,"The boy (Michiel) scored with the blue ball, the soccer ball, and the tennis ball.

**Explanation:** The video shows a scoreboard with icons for each item next to the names ""Celine"" and ""Michiel"". After Michiel successfully gets the blue ball, the soccer ball, and the tennis ball into the goal, a green checkmark appears next to the corresponding icon under his name, indicating a successful score for each item."
0595-1,"The boy (Michiel) used a **large blue exercise ball, a soccer ball, and a tennis ball** to score.

**Explanation:** The video shows Michiel successfully getting each of these three types of balls into the goal, indicated by the green checkmarks appearing next to the corresponding ball icons under his name after each successful attempt."
0595-2,"Yes, the boy (Michiel) scored with the blue exercise ball, the soccer ball, and the tennis ball. The video shows him successfully throwing each ball over the net and into the pool, with green checkmarks appearing under his name to confirm each score."

*Explanation:* They are constantly running to follow the main actor, demonstrating physical capability. They also act as the videographer, maintaining framing while moving, and actively participate by interacting verbally in several scenes, indicating collaboration."
0597-1,"The person operating the camera is running alongside the actors, keeping pace with them while maintaining a relatively low and steady camera angle. They are positioned close to the action, actively tracking the subjects, and moving smoothly despite being in motion, suggesting physical fitness and coordination with the performers."
0597-2,"Yes, the person portraying the photographer is wearing a light gray jacket (or pullover) and white sneakers.

*   **Explanation:** In the segment labeled ""Photographer"" (around 0:18), the actor playing the photographer clearly wears a light gray top that resembles a jacket or thick pullover, along with white sneakers."
0597-3,"**Cannot be determined.**

**Explanation:** The video is filmed from a first-person perspective, meaning the person holding the camera is never shown on screen. Therefore, it's impossible to determine what clothing or shoes they are wearing."

*   Gets splashed with water when his final balloon is popped.
*   Uses a knife to pop the opponent's balloons."
0603-1,"The person who failed twice in a row (at 00:31 and 00:41) and lost their final heart (at 00:43) is the male competitor wearing a blue T-shirt, dark athletic pants with white stripes, and no shoes (barefoot). He has dark hair and a beard. He failed two consecutive ground-based acrobatic moves, landing outside his blue hoop each time. After the second failure, his opponent popped his blue balloon, causing his final blue heart icon to disappear and drenching him with water."
0603-2,"**Answer:** Yes

**Explanation:** The person wearing the blue shirt and dark blue pants lost two hearts consecutively at 00:34 and 00:44."
0603-3,"**Answer:** No.

**Explanation:** The person described (red shirt with 'M' logo, pink hula hoop) is Player Red. Player Red fails twice during the video (around 0:02 and 0:18), resulting in the loss of two hearts (at 0:05 and 0:22). However, these failures were not on consecutive turns, and Player Red finishes the clip with one heart remaining.

0607-1,"**Position:** The man is hanging upside down from the ceiling, suspended by specialized devices attached to his feet.

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows the man oriented vertically with his head towards the floor and his feet towards the ceiling. He is not touching the ground and is held in place by black, gear-like objects affixed to both the ceiling and his feet, keeping him suspended."
0607-2,"**No.** The man is hanging upside down from the actual ceiling. This is evident because gravity acts normally in the video: the basketball falls downwards towards the floor, and the balloons float upwards towards the ceiling. Additionally, the furniture and room orientation are standard, not inverted."
0607-3,"No, he is not standing on the ceiling. He is hanging upside down from it, attached by equipment on his feet."
0607-7,C
0609-0,"**Red Ball:** The participants pass a red ball around the table, and the person holding it when the passing stops is eliminated."
0609-1,"**Answer:** Elimination is decided by who the spinning red object points towards when it stops spinning.

**Explanation:** The participants spin the red object on the table, and the person it is pointing at when it comes to a complete stop is the one eliminated from that round of the game."
0609-2,"**Yes.**

**Explanation:** Elimination occurs if participants lift their hands off the table *before* the person holding the ball actually releases it. Reacting prematurely, often to a fake release, results in elimination."
0609-3,"No, elimination is not determined by who is holding the ball when it stops.

**Explanation:** The video shows the ball spinning freely on the table after being pushed. Elimination appears to be determined by who the ball is pointing at or stops closest to when it finishes spinning, not by anyone holding it at that moment."
0609-7,C
0610-0,"The woman threw the package out of the window as a quick and comedic way to delegate the task of mailing it to the two men. This action is part of the video's running gag where the men provide instant, hyper-efficient service for her every need, exaggerating the concept of convenience."
0610-1,"**Answer:** She tossed the package out the window as an immediate and efficient way to delegate the task of mailing it to her two assistants.

**Explanation:** Throughout the video, the two men are shown providing hyper-efficient, instant service for the woman (setting the table, making the bed, unloading groceries). Tossing the package is consistent with this theme; it's the quickest way for her to hand off the task to the men, who appear immediately outside to catch it and run off, presumably to mail it."
0610-2,"**No**, the video clip is played in reverse. The men actually brought the package from outside and tossed it through the window to the woman."
0610-3,"Yes, she threw it quickly, but the context of the men waiting outside and immediately retrieving it indicates it was a planned, efficient handoff rather than simply trying to discard it."

0612-0,"According to the video, the paper is divided into two parts **to directly compare the results, process, and quality of using free/found materials versus expensive colored pencils on the exact same base drawing.**

The left side, labeled ""$0 Pencils,"" utilizes unconventional items like burnt matches, coffee, grass, and berries as pigments. The right side, labeled ""$300 Pencils,"" uses traditional, expensive colored pencils. This division allows for a clear, side-by-side visual comparison of the outcomes achievable with vastly different cost materials and techniques."
0612-1,"The paper is divided into two sections to provide a clear, side-by-side comparison and visually demonstrate the contrast in results between creating the artwork using $0 found materials (like burnt matches, coffee, grass) and using $300 professional colored pencils on the same subject."
0612-2,"Yes, the purpose of dividing the paper is explicitly to compare the results achieved using non-traditional, essentially free materials (labeled ""$0 Pencils"") on one side against the results achieved using expensive, traditional colored pencils (labeled ""$300 Pencils"") on the other side. The split format allows for a direct visual juxtaposition of the two methods and their outcomes."
0612-3,"Yes, the dividing line is specifically to compare the results of using zero-cost, unconventional materials (like burnt matches, coffee, grass used as pigments) on the ""$0 Pencils"" side against the results of using expensive, actual colored pencils on the ""$300 Pencils"" side. The ""$0"" side uses found items *for* color, not specific drawing tools themselves, although applicators like matchsticks or brushes are used."
0612-7,D
0614-0,"The man's hands are trembling likely due to a combination of **nervousness and anticipation** regarding his interaction with the waitress, especially considering he plans to give her a gift later in the video. It could also be interpreted as **fidgeting** while waiting for his food or potentially **acting** if the scenario is staged for the video."
0614-1,"The man's hands are likely trembling due to nervousness, anxiety, or anticipation related to the social interaction with the waitress, possibly combined with the awareness of being filmed or general stress."
0614-2,"Yes, the man appears to be pretending his hands are trembling.

**Explanation:** His hands shake significantly while trying to eat and drink, prompting the waitress to help him. Immediately after she assists, his hands stop shaking completely, he smiles, points at her, and gives her a gift from his backpack. This sudden cessation of symptoms combined with the reward strongly suggests the trembling was an act, likely part of a staged video or social experiment designed to test and reward kindness."
0614-3,"Based on the video, the man's trembling hands could plausibly be due to a **combination of nervousness and excitement**.

**Explanation:** He appears focused on the waitress and later gives her a gift, suggesting he is anticipating the interaction. This anticipation likely involves nervousness about how the interaction will go (especially giving the gift) and excitement about the possibility of a positive connection or reaction."

0616-0,"**The white/yellow ball** reaches the finish line first.

**Explanation:** Although the blue and black balls start slightly earlier and from further up the track, the white/yellow ball starts much closer to the finish line. Due to the significantly shorter distance it needs to travel, it reaches the narrow end channel before the other two balls."
0616-1,"**The white ball** crosses the finish line first.

**Explanation:** Although the blue and black balls start earlier, the white ball, starting last, navigates the obstacles more efficiently in the latter part of the course and enters the final narrow channel at the bottom ahead of the other two."
0616-2,"Yes, the white ball is the first to reach the finish line. Although it starts last and from the furthest back position, it navigates the obstacles more efficiently and overtakes the other two balls to finish first."

**Explanation:** The video shows the man inverted, with devices on his feet adhering to the ceiling, suspending his body below. He is not standing upright on the floor."
0620-1,"**Position:** The man is **hanging upside down (inverted), suspended from the ceiling by specialized devices attached to his feet.**

**Explanation:** His body is oriented vertically with his head pointing towards the floor. He is held in this position against gravity because his feet are secured to the ceiling using gear-like gripping devices."
0620-2,"**No.** The man is hanging upside down from the actual ceiling using specialized equipment on his feet. This is confirmed by gravity acting normally (the basketball falls downwards towards the floor, his hair hangs down relative to his head), the balloons floating upwards towards the ceiling he is attached to, and the normal orientation of the room's furniture."
0620-3,"No, he is not standing on the ceiling. He is hanging upside down from it, attached by equipment on his feet."
0620-7,B
0621-0,"**Mini Michiel's right foot.**

**Explanation:** At the beginning of the video, Mini Michiel is already positioned leaning against the wall with his right shoulder and side, and his right foot is angled towards the wall, supporting this lean."
0621-1,"**Answer:** Right foot

**Explanation:** All five individuals in the video place their right foot against the wall first when they begin to lean."
0621-2,"**No.**

**Explanation:** The video shows that the individuals who successfully lean back (Michiel and Mini Michiel) make contact with their upper body (back/shoulders) first, while their feet remain planted on the ground. The other individuals fall forward and do not lean against the wall. Therefore, the left foot is not the first point of contact for anyone."
0621-3,"**Answer:** No.

**Explanation:** The people in the video lean their backs or shoulders against the wall, not their feet. The feet remain on the ground for support. The leaning action happens simultaneously for the individuals who lean against the wall."
0621-7,C
0625-0,"**Left / Horizontally Left**

**Explanation:** The second ball appears on the right side of the horizontal groove and moves along that groove towards the center, which is a displacement to the left from its starting position."
0625-1,The second ball moves left. It appears on the right side of the horizontal track and travels horizontally towards the left.
0625-2,"**Answer:** No.
**Explanation:** The second ball appears on the right side of the horizontal groove and moves only leftward towards the center; it does not move back to the right."
0625-3,"No, the second ball does not follow a circular path or move in a loop. It appears on the right and moves in a straight line horizontally towards the center along a track segment."
0625-7,A
0627-0,**The woman:** She is initially standing behind the green cutout and shifts her position slightly as the camera moves around the object.
0627-1,"**The woman** changed her position in the video.

**Explanation:** As the camera moves around the green cardboard cutout, the woman standing behind it shifts her body, leans, and adjusts her stance relative to the cutout."
0627-2,"Yes, the photographer (the person holding the camera) is moving.

**Explanation:** The video shows the scene from multiple angles, indicating the person filming is walking around the cardboard cutout. This movement changes the camera's perspective, which alters how the cutout (demonstrating the illusion) and the woman behind it are viewed."
0627-3,"**No**, the woman moves herself around the stationary object. This movement changes her viewing perspective, creating the optical illusion that the object's head is turning to follow her."
0627-7,A
0633-0,"**Left.**

**Explanation:** At the very end of the video (around 0:18-0:19), the black car is shown driving forward in the snow, and its front wheels are clearly angled towards the left."
0633-1,"**Counter-clockwise:** The black car is shown driving forward at the conclusion of the video. When viewed from the left side, the wheels must rotate counter-clockwise to propel the vehicle forward."
0633-2,"Yes, the wheels of the black car turn forward at the end of the video. This is evident because the car itself is moving forward through the snow, which requires the wheels to rotate in the direction of travel."
0633-3,"No, the wheels of the black car are turning forward. The car is moving forward through the snow, and the rotation of the wheels is consistent with this forward direction."
0633-7,B
0643-0,"Based on the video, the wind is blowing from the left towards the right (from the viewer's perspective). This is shown by the flag unfurling and billowing out towards the right side of the screen."
0643-1,"Observe the flag's movement: The flag unfurls and blows towards the left side of the screen, indicating the wind direction."
0643-2,"**Yes:** The flag held by the soldier on the right is billowing towards the right side of the screen, indicating the wind is blowing from the left towards the right."
0643-3,"Yes, the video shows the wind blowing from the right side of the screen to the left. This is evident because the flag held by the soldier on the right is billowing strongly towards the left."
0643-7,D
0645-0,"**Answer:** On the right side of the student's body (camera view).

**Explanation:** At the beginning of the video, the student holds the left end of the scarf (relative to the camera) in her left hand. After wrapping the scarf around her neck, this same end hangs down on the right side of her body from the camera's perspective."
0645-1,"The left end of the scarf ends up **hanging down the front on the left side (camera's perspective)**.

**Explanation:** The student wraps the scarf around their neck. The end initially held in their right hand (which appears on the left side from the camera's view) is brought around and ends up hanging vertically down the front of their torso, positioned on the left side as seen by the camera."
0645-2,"**Answer:** No
**Explanation:** The student wraps the scarf around her neck, causing the left end to cross over and hang on her right side."
0645-3,"**No.** At the end of the video, the left end of the scarf is hanging down on the student's left side."
0645-7,B
0652-0,"The car spun out and stopped facing backwards on the right shoulder of the road.

**Explanation:**
After losing control at high speed on the wet road, the car rotated approximately 180 degrees (spun out) while moving across the travel lanes to the right. It came to a complete stop off the main travel lanes, on what appears to be the shoulder area, facing the opposite direction from which it was originally traveling."
0652-1,"**Answer:** The car ended up on the right shoulder of the highway, near the guardrail, facing roughly backwards or perpendicular to the original direction of travel."
0652-2,"Yes, after spinning across the lanes, the car comes to rest in the innermost (leftmost) lane, facing the original direction of travel."
0652-3,"No, the car spun but did not end up facing the opposite direction. It came to a stop facing mostly forward, in its original direction of travel."
0652-7,D
0655-0,"**Answer:** They are moving at approximately the same speed.

**Explanation:** The camera stays alongside the truck, maintaining a relatively constant distance and angle. This indicates that the vehicle carrying the camera is matching the truck's speed to keep it in frame for filming."
0655-1,"**The camera moves faster than the truck.**

**Explanation:** The camera starts focused on the rear of the Batmobile/truck and then pans forward along its side. To achieve this panning motion while both are moving forward, the camera vehicle must travel slightly faster than the truck to change its relative position alongside it."
0655-2,"**No.**

**Explanation:** The camera maintains a relatively consistent position alongside the truck, keeping it framed. This indicates their speeds are closely matched, as is typical for a parallel tracking shot. If the camera were moving faster, the truck would appear to fall behind in the frame."
0655-3,"**No.** The camera appears to be moving alongside the truck, keeping it relatively centered in the frame, which indicates they are traveling at approximately the same speed."
0655-7,D
0658-0,"**Answer:** The rider in the black/dark grey jersey is faster.
**Explanation:** This rider takes the lead immediately after the starting gate drops and maintains a clear advantage over the other rider throughout the visible portion of the race down the track."
0658-1,"**Answer:** The rider in the black jersey (right lane) is quicker.
**Explanation:** This rider gets a significantly better start out of the gate, accelerates faster down the ramp, and pulls ahead immediately, establishing a clear lead early in the race."
0658-2,"Yes, the rider in the black outfit is the faster one during the race.
Explanation: The rider in black gets a quicker start out of the gate, immediately pulls ahead of the other rider, and significantly increases their lead down the first straight and into the first turn."
0658-3,Error
0658-7,A
0664-0,"**Answer:** 10
**Explanation:** The woman rolls the dice 10 separate times during her turn playing the game, as observed by counting each instance she throws the dice onto the board."
0664-1,The woman threw the dice 10 times. We can count each instance where she picks up the dice and rolls them onto the game board.
0664-2,**No.** The woman rolled the dice 10 times during the game shown.
0664-3,"No, the woman did not roll the dice 11 times. She rolled the dice 10 times to successfully ""Shut the Box""."
0664-7,B
0667-0,"7 people participated.

Six individuals actively took turns dropping the balloon and attempting to catch it (Celine, Bram, Laura, Ise, Michiel, Anna), and one additional person sat on the stairs observing the challenge throughout the video."
0667-1,"**7 participants**

**Explanation:** There are 6 individuals who actively take turns attempting the balloon challenge (Celine, Bram, Laura, Ise, Michiel, and the winner Anna), plus one additional person consistently sitting on the stairs observing the game, making a total of 7 people involved."
0667-2,"**Yes**

**Explanation:** Six distinct individuals (Celine, Bram, Laura, Ise, Michiel, Anna) are shown actively taking turns in the challenge."
0667-3,"**No**, there are only **6** people visible in the video participating in or observing the challenge. There is one person on the upper level throwing the balloon, four people on the ground level reacting to it, and one person sitting on the stairs observing."
0667-7,C
0670-0,"**4**

**Explanation:** The video shows four distinct children jumping or flipping off the dock into the water during the sequence where the man is also participating (around timestamps 0:12, 0:15, 0:21, and 0:27)."
0670-1,"**3**

**Explanation:** The video shows three distinct children jumping from the dock into the water at different points (around 0:13, 0:15, and 0:27)."
0670-2,"**False.**

The video clearly shows at least two different children jumping into the water from the dock (around 0:12 and 0:14). Furthermore, several other children are present on the dock and in the water during this activity, strongly suggesting it was a group event where more than just two children participated in jumping."
0670-3,"**No.** The video shows three children jumping into the water at different times (around 0:12, 0:14, and 0:20), not four."
0670-7,D
0673-0,"There are **3** buckets of real popcorn shown in the video.

**Explanation:**
Three individuals (the woman next to the prankster and the two people in the row behind) are holding standard yellow popcorn buckets filled with what appears to be real popcorn. The person with green hair initially holds a fake pile of popcorn, not in a bucket."
0673-1,"**4**
Explanation: There are four yellow buckets labeled ""POPCORN"" visible. One person initially holds a fake popcorn top, but then reveals and uses the actual popcorn bucket underneath. The other three people also have buckets containing actual popcorn."
0673-2,"Yes, there are two (in fact, three) buckets of real popcorn shown in the video. The woman sitting next to the person with green hair and the two individuals in the row behind them all have standard popcorn buckets filled with real popcorn they are eating."
0673-3,"**No**, there are not four buckets of real popcorn shown.

**Explanation:** The video shows four people, but the person in the foreground with green hair initially holds popcorn glued to a piece of cardboard labeled ""FAKE"". While the other three people have buckets that appear to contain real popcorn, one of the four instances is explicitly shown to be fake."
0673-7,C
0675-0,"The man on the left felt **comically surprised and playfully exasperated**.

**Explanation:** After the final trick reveal (the AirPods), his wide-eyed expression, pointing finger towards the man on the right, and look towards the camera indicate he was humorously surprised and caught off guard by the simple sleight of hand used to perform the trick, reacting with amusement and mock exasperation at being fooled."
0675-1,"**Reaction:** The man on the left reacted with feigned surprise or mock astonishment, often followed by amusement, smiling, and playful gestures (like pointing).

**Explanation:** His reactions were part of a planned performance or skit. He was collaborating with the man on the right, acting surprised for comedic and entertainment effect as the tricks were revealed, rather than being genuinely fooled or upset."
0675-2,"**No**, the man on the left did not feel displeased. Throughout the video, his facial expressions and body language consistently show amusement, happiness, and active, willing participation in the magic tricks alongside the younger man. He smiles and laughs, indicating enjoyment rather than displeasure at the reveals."
0675-3,"**No.**

**Explanation:** The video does not show the magic tricks being explained after they were performed. The man on the left reacts with amusement, surprise, and smiles *during* the performance and immediate reveal of each trick (like the knife retracting or the AirPods appearing), indicating he was impressed and entertained by the illusions themselves, not by a separate explanation which is not depicted in the footage."
0675-7,B
0679-0,"**Answer:** The lady feels shocked and surprised.

**Explanation:** At the end of the video, the lady's eyes widen significantly and her mouth drops open as she looks towards where the man suddenly disappeared from the stool next to her. This facial expression is a classic, immediate reaction to an unexpected and startling event, indicating shock and surprise."
0679-1,"The woman reacts with **shock, surprise, and disbelief**.

**Explanation:** Her jaw drops open, her eyes widen significantly, and she stares fixedly at the stool post where the seat was just moments before, clearly astonished and unable to immediately process the bizarre event."
0679-2,"Yes, the woman clearly feels surprised. Her mouth drops open and her eyes widen in a classic expression of shock when she sees the empty space where the man and stool were just moments before."
0679-3,"No, the woman does not appear upset or frustrated at the end of the video.

Her reaction, characterized by wide eyes and an open mouth directed towards the fallen stool, strongly indicates she was shocked or startled by the sudden loud noise and the unexpected event happening right next to her."
0679-7,B
0689-0,"Based on the video, the man in the purple T-shirt changed the other man's lock screen wallpaper to his own photo **as a lighthearted prank.**

**Explanation:** His actions (approaching excitedly, quickly changing the wallpaper, laughing heartily afterward) and the other man's surprised reaction strongly suggest it was done playfully to be funny, mischievous, and get a reaction from his friend, which are all hallmarks of a common prank among friends."
0689-1,"The man changed the lock screen wallpaper as a **lighthearted prank** intended **to be funny, tease his friend, and provoke a surprised or amused reaction.** It was a spontaneous, mischievous act taking advantage of the unattended phone, likely done for comedic effect and potentially to create entertaining content."
0689-2,"Yes, the man in the purple T-shirt changed the lock screen wallpaper to his own photo.

**Explanation:** The video shows him accessing the phone while the owner is sitting, selecting his own picture from the gallery, using the phone's interface options (implied to be ""Set as Wallpaper""), locking the phone, and then showing the phone to the original owner, revealing his own face on the lock screen, much to the owner's surprise."
0689-3,"Yes, the man in the purple T-shirt changed the lock screen wallpaper to his own photo as a prank.

**Explanation:** The video shows him taking the phone, selecting a photo of himself from the gallery, setting it as the wallpaper, and then laughing as he shows the changed lock screen to the phone's owner, whose reaction indicates surprise."

0690-0,"The child is lying on the ground **to watch the shell game** her parents are playing on the coffee table above her. Her position gives her a **clear, low-angle vantage point** of the action, and it is likely **part of a staged skit** being filmed, where her role is to observe the game closely from below."
0690-1,"The child is lying on the floor as part of a planned or staged scenario, likely for filming a funny video or skit. Her position gives her a unique, close-up view of the shell game her parents are playing on the coffee table, allowing her to be an engaged spectator or participant in the scene."
0690-2,"Yes, the child is lying on the ground specifically to reach under the coffee table and secretly take the money while the man is performing the shell game trick. The video shows the child reaching up from their position on the floor to grab the money from under the bowl during the shuffling."
0690-3,"**Playing.**

The child is lying on the floor directly beneath the coffee table where the adults are playing a shell game. They are looking up and actively watching the game unfold, indicating engagement and participation as an observer rather than simply relaxing independently."

0695-0,"**The woman won.**

She successfully arranged her cups (Orange, Green, Purple, Blue) to match the man's arrangement (Yellow, Red, Black, Blue) on her final turn, indicated by the ""You got it!"" confirmation and her celebration, thus achieving the winning condition of 4 matches."
0695-1,"**The woman** emerged as the winner.

**Explanation:** In the final round shown in the video, the woman arranges her cups in the sequence Green, Blue, Purple, Orange. The off-screen judge confirms this is the correct sequence by saying, ""You got it!"", indicating she achieved a perfect score of 4 matches and won the game."
0695-2,"Yes, the woman won the game because she arranged her cups in the correct order. The off-screen voice confirmed her win by saying, ""You got it!"" after her final arrangement, indicating she achieved 4 matches, meaning her sequence perfectly matched the man's hidden sequence."
0695-3,"No, the man did not win the game. The woman won because she was the first to correctly arrange her cups to match the hidden sequence, achieving a score of 4 correct cups. The game is turn-based and relies on memory and deduction to find the correct order, not the speed at which the cups are moved during a turn."
0695-7,A
0706-0,"The purpose of the man's actions is to record the base footage of his performance. These raw movements are the live-action component needed for post-production, where special effects (VFX) will be added to create the final video sequence."
0706-1,He is filming himself performing specific actions and choreography on the beach. This is done to capture the raw footage needed as the base layer for a creative video project that will involve adding special effects in post-production.
0706-2,"Yes, the man is shooting footage for a video with special effects.

**Explanation:** The first part of the video shows the man setting up a camera and performing actions on the beach. The second part shows the same scene and actions but with added visual effects like a shadowy clone, energy effects, and the ground cracking, demonstrating that the initial filming was the basis for the final edited video."
0706-3,"Yes, the man in the first half of the video is setting up a camera on a tripod to record himself. The video clearly shows him adjusting the camera and then stepping back to perform dynamic, martial arts-style movements in front of it, which are then shown with special effects."
0706-7,B
0707-0,"The person runs towards the camera **to create a dynamic transition and visual effect, common in social media video trends, which emphasizes the drink by bringing it rapidly into a close-up that fills the frame.**"
0707-1,"The person runs towards the camera as part of a planned video sequence. This movement creates a dynamic transition from a wider shot (showing him dancing) to a close-up, specifically highlighting the drink he is holding and presenting it clearly to the viewer for the final shot."
0707-2,"Yes, the person runs towards the camera to show the drink up close. This action is clearly intended to capture a specific close-up shot of the drink, which will likely be edited into the final video during post-production."
0707-3,"**Answer:** No, the person does not run towards the camera initially.
**Specific Action:** After starting the recording, he runs *away* from the camera, then turns back to perform dance moves and poses while showcasing his drink, eventually bringing the drink close to the camera for emphasis."
0707-7,A
0708-0,"The cat's scream in the last shot is most likely a **comedic reaction, possibly an edited yawn, expressing mock horror, exasperation, or a villainous laugh (Combination of 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 15, 26, 31)**.

**Explanation:** The cat has just been involved in bath-related chaos (knocking products into the tub). Seeing the owner unpack an overwhelming amount of *new* toiletries likely triggers this exaggerated, dramatic response for comedic effect, playing on themes of being overwhelmed, protesting baths/shopping, or relishing the potential for more mischief."
0708-1,"The cat is yelling in the final scene out of **frustration and defiance**, framed for comedic effect like an **evil villain's maniacal laugh**. Its destructive efforts were immediately undone by the owner replacing all the toiletries, and the yell signifies both its annoyance at being thwarted and a defiant, mocking warning that it might just destroy the new items too."
0708-2,"**Yes**, the video strongly implies the cat screamed because it saw more bath products being brought in.

**Explanation:** The video shows the cat making a mess of bath products in the tub, seemingly in defiance or an attempt to destroy them. Immediately following this scene, the owner arrives with shopping bags and unpacks a large quantity of new bath products. The cat's dramatic scream occurs precisely at this moment, suggesting its reaction is one of frustration, dismay, or horror at seeing its efforts undone and facing even more bath products."
0708-3,"**No.**

The video shows the cat actively creating the mess by pushing the bath products into the tub. The final ""scream"" occurs after the owner arrives and reveals newly purchased replacement products. This timing suggests the cat's expression is a comedic reaction to the owner bringing replacements for the items it just destroyed, rather than being upset about the mess itself."
0708-7,C
0721-0,"**Answer:** An airplane.
*   **Explanation:** The man is using forced perspective to create the illusion that he is holding a large LOT Polish Airlines airplane in his hand as it flies overhead, likely preparing to land."
0721-1,"He is positioning his hand under the airplane to create a forced perspective illusion, making it appear as though he is holding or supporting the aircraft."
0721-2,"No, the man in sunglasses is not actually holding the airplane. This is an optical illusion created using forced perspective, where the man is much closer to the camera than the airplane, making the distant plane appear smaller and aligned with his hand."
0721-3,"No, the man in sunglasses is not holding a toy airplane. He is using forced perspective to create the illusion that he is holding a real, full-sized airplane in the background."
0721-7,C
0723-0,"The little monster looks like it's active because of an **optical illusion** known as the **hollow-face illusion**.

**Explanation:**

The monster's head is built with a **concave** shape (curving inwards), like the inside of a mask. However, our brains are strongly wired to perceive faces as **convex** (bulging outwards). When the camera moves, the **perspective** on the concave surfaces changes. Because our brain insists on interpreting the shape as convex, it misinterprets these perspective shifts, causing the monster's eyes and snout to **appear to turn and follow** the camera's movement. It's a trick of **depth perception** and the brain's powerful facial recognition bias overriding the actual physical shape."
0723-1,"The monster appears to move because its head is built concave (hollowed inward), creating a **Hollow-Face Illusion**. Our brains strongly assume faces are convex (bulging outward). As the viewer moves, the brain misinterprets the changing perspective and shading cues on the concave surface, perceiving it as a convex face turning to follow."
0723-2,"Yes, the monster appears to move due to the hollow-face illusion. Its head is built concave (inward), but our brain perceives it as convex (outward), causing its features to seem to follow the viewer's movement as the viewing angle changes."
0723-3,"**Answer:** No, the apparent movement is not because someone is manipulating the monster cutout directly.

**Explanation:** The video explains that the monster's head appears to move due to an optical illusion, specifically the hollow-face illusion. The monster's head is built concavely (curving inward), but our brain interprets it as convex (curving outward). As the viewer's perspective (the camera) changes, the concave features create the illusion that the head is turning to follow the viewer. The woman behind it is just demonstrating the scale and interacting with the object, not physically turning its head to create the effect."
0723-7,D
0724-0,"**Why the pen passes through the banknote without breaking it:**

The trick relies on a specific folding technique. The banknote is folded in a way (often a 'Z' or 'S' fold) that creates a hidden gap or channel between the layers of the paper. The pen is then inserted into this gap, passing *between* the folded layers rather than actually piercing the material. Because the pen never punctures the paper, the banknote remains undamaged when unfolded.

**How the banknote is folded:**

Typically, the banknote is:
1.  Folded in half lengthwise.
2.  Folded in half widthwise.
3.  One of the top edges is then folded back partway, creating an offset or a 'Z'/'S' shape when viewed from the side. This final fold creates the necessary hidden gap for the pen to pass through."
0724-1,"**How the Banknote is Folded:**

1.  The banknote is first folded in half lengthwise (like a hotdog bun).
2.  It is then folded again, typically into thirds, creating a 'Z' or 'S' shape when viewed from the edge (an accordion fold).

**Explanation:**

This specific folding method creates overlapping layers of the banknote. A hidden channel or gap runs through the middle section *between* these folded layers, not *through* the paper itself. The pen is inserted into this channel and slides along the gap. This gives the illusion that the pen is piercing the banknote, but it is actually just passing between the folds. When the banknote is unfolded, there is no hole because the paper was never torn."
0724-2,"Yes, the banknote remains intact because the way it is folded creates an opening or gap. The pen is actually passed through this gap in the fold, not through the solid material of the banknote itself, creating the illusion of penetration."
0724-3,"Yes, the banknote is not broken because the pen has a hidden mechanism. It's a specially designed magic prop pen that can separate, often held together by magnets or a specific joint, allowing the banknote to be placed in the gap to create the illusion of penetration without actually damaging the bill."
0724-7,C
0725-0,The drink in the bottle decreased because the man first drank some of it directly from the bottle and then poured the remaining liquid into a separate beaker to prepare the bottle for a trick.
0725-1,"**Answer:**

Blowing air into the bottle increases the air pressure inside. This pressure pushes down on the liquid, forcing it out through a hidden hole in the side of the bottle, which causes the liquid level to drop. The tutorial section reveals how this hole was created and covered."
0725-2,"Yes, the drink level is decreasing because the balloon inside the bottle is deflating.

**Explanation:** The tutorial segment clearly shows a balloon being inserted into the bottle through a side hole, inflated, and sealed. The Fanta is then poured back in around the inflated balloon. When the man pretends to drink, he is actually letting the air out of the balloon (deflating it). As the balloon shrinks, it displaces less liquid, causing the visible liquid level in the bottle to drop."
0725-3,"No, the drink level is not decreasing because it is being consumed through the straw. The video shows a tutorial revealing that the man is actually blowing air through the straw into a hidden balloon inside the bottle. Inflating the balloon displaces the liquid, causing the level to rise, not decrease."
0725-7,A
0729-0,"**Red**

**Explanation:** The video uses a blue strip (identical in size to the red one) to compare against the black strip. When overlaid, the black strip clearly extends further on both ends than the blue/red strip, demonstrating that the black strip is longer. Therefore, the red strip is the shorter one."
0729-1,"**A: 黑色长 (Black is longer)**

**Explanation:** The video demonstrates this using a blue strip identical in size to the red strip. When the blue strip is compared to the black strip, the black strip is visibly longer."
0729-2,"Yes, the black strip is longer than the red strip.

Explanation: The video uses a blue strip to compare the lengths. The blue strip is shown to be longer than the red strip, and then it is shown to be the same length as the black strip. Therefore, the black strip is longer than the red strip."
0729-3,"No, the black strip is not the shortest. The video demonstrates, using the blue comparison strip and selecting option A, that the black strip is longer than the red strip."
0729-7,A
0731-0,"**Answer:** A mermaid sitting on a rock.

**Explanation:** Based on dual perception, the shape that forms the old man's nose within the larger face illusion is clearly depicted as a mermaid (a figure with a woman's upper body and a fish's tail) seated upon a rock in the seascape."
0731-1,The old man's nose represents **a mermaid sitting on a rock**.
0731-2,"Yes, the old man's nose is indeed formed by the image of a mermaid sitting on a rock or reef in the sea. The blonde mermaid figure and the rock she is perched upon create the shape and contour of the nose within the larger optical illusion of the man's face."
0731-3,"Yes, the old man's nose can be perceived as the head and beak of a bird.

**Explanation:**
The artist has cleverly used the form of a bird, specifically its head and beak, to represent the nose of the old man in the optical illusion. The bird's head and beak are positioned and shaped precisely to function as the nose within the larger composition of the old man's face. This is a key element of the visual trick, where one object (the bird's head/beak) doubles as a feature of another (the old man's nose)."
0731-7,A
0735-0,"The artboard holds a mirror, and the scenery seen is the reflection of the actual sunset landscape behind the easel."
0735-1,"The scenery appears on the artboard because the ""artboard"" is actually a **mirror reflecting the real sunset scenery** located behind the camera/viewer. The action with the paintbrush is performative to create the illusion of painting."
0735-2,"Yes, the scenery on the artboard in the second segment is a reflection of the environment. The object placed on the easel is a mirror, which reflects the actual sunset and water visible in the background."

0738-0,"The man filmed the sky changing from dark to bright by manually adjusting the exposure setting on his phone while recording. He first tapped the screen, then dragged his finger down to lower the exposure (making the scene dark), started recording, and then dragged his finger up during the recording to increase the exposure (making the scene bright)."
0738-1,"The man manually increased the exposure/brightness while recording the video. He did this by tapping the screen to set focus/initial exposure and then dragging his finger upwards on the screen, using the phone's camera app interface to make the image progressively brighter."
0738-2,"**Answer:** No

**Explanation:** The man adjusted the camera's exposure settings by dragging his finger *down*, which *decreases* the brightness (exposure) on the phone screen, making the preview image darker. This is often done to capture detail in bright areas like a sunset. The final video clip shown transitions from dark to bright, which is likely due to the camera's auto-exposure adjusting, a time-lapse effect, or editing, not the direct result of the downward swipe action shown."
0738-3,"No, the man did not use a time-lapse feature to show the sky changing from black to bright. He manually lowered the exposure setting on his phone's camera before starting a standard video recording of the sunset, making the scene appear darker initially for a dramatic effect."

0740-0,"**Answer:** 4(4) = 16

**Explanation:** Following the order of operations (PEMDAS) as demonstrated in the video:
1.  **Parentheses:** (2 + 2) = 4. The expression becomes 8 ÷ 2(4).
2.  **Division (Left-to-Right):** 8 ÷ 2 = 4. The expression becomes 4(4).
3.  **Multiplication:** 4(4) = 16. This is the third calculation step shown in the video's explanation."
0740-1,"The third step is **multiplying 4 by 4**.

**Explanation:**
1.  The first step shown is calculating the value inside the parentheses: (2 + 2) = 4. The expression becomes 8 ÷ 2(4).
2.  The second step shown applies the left-to-right rule for division and multiplication (which have equal precedence): 8 ÷ 2 = 4. The expression becomes 4(4).
3.  The third step shown is performing the remaining multiplication: 4 * 4 = 16."
0740-2,"Yes. After solving the parentheses (2+2 = 4) to get 8 ÷ 2(4), the video performs the division from left to right (8 ÷ 2 = 4) resulting in 4(4). The final step shown is calculating this multiplication, 4 × 4, to get 16."
0740-3,"Yes, the third step shown in the video is performing the division of 8 ÷ 2.

**Explanation:**
Following the PEMDAS/BODMAS order of operations:
1.  **Parentheses/Brackets:** (2 + 2) = 4. The expression becomes 8 ÷ 2(4).
2.  **Multiplication and Division (from left to right):** Since multiplication (implied by 2(4)) and division (8 ÷ 2) have equal precedence, they are performed from left to right. The leftmost operation is 8 ÷ 2.
3.  Therefore, the third step shown correctly performs the division 8 ÷ 2 = 4."

0742-0,"The value of **x = 18**.

**Explanation:**
The diagram shows angles on a straight line. One angle is a right angle (90°). The other three angles (x°, 2x°, and 2x°) must sum up to the remaining 90° to make the total 180°. Therefore, the equation is x + 2x + 2x = 90. Combining the terms gives 5x = 90. Dividing both sides by 5 results in x = 18."
0742-1,"To determine the value of x in the given diagram:

1.  **Recognize the Angles:** Identify the straight line (which represents 180°) and the marked right angle (90°).
2.  **Find the Complementary Sum:** The angles labeled x°, 2x°, and 2x° are adjacent to the right angle and lie on the straight line. Therefore, their sum must equal the remaining part of the straight angle, which is 180° - 90° = 90°.
3.  **Set Up the Equation:** Write an equation representing the sum of these angles: x + 2x + 2x = 90.
4.  **Combine Like Terms:** Simplify the equation by adding the terms with x: 5x = 90.
5.  **Solve for x:** Divide both sides of the equation by 5 to isolate x: x = 90 / 5.
6.  **Calculate the Value:** Perform the division: x = 18."
0742-2,"Yes, the value of x is 18.

**Explanation:**
The diagram shows angles on a straight line. One angle is a right angle (90°). The sum of the adjacent angles (x°, 2x°, and 2x°) must also equal 90° because angles on a straight line add up to 180°. Therefore, the equation is x + 2x + 2x = 90. Combining terms gives 5x = 90. Dividing both sides by 5 yields x = 18."
0742-3,"**No**, the value of x is not 25.

**Explanation:** The diagram shows angles x°, 2x°, and 2x° adjacent to a 90° angle on a straight line. Angles on a straight line add up to 180°. Therefore, the sum of x°, 2x°, and 2x° must be 90° (180° - 90° = 90°).

The equation is:
x + 2x + 2x = 90
5x = 90
x = 90 / 5
x = 18

So, the value of x is 18, not 25."

0749-0,"Both the rice grains and the yellow liquid pass through the sieve.

**Explanation:** The rice grains pass through because their individual size is smaller than the openings in the sieve mesh. The yellow liquid passes through because, as a fluid, it flows freely through the openings."
0749-1,"**Rice grains** pass through the sieve in the first experiment.

**Explanation:** The individual rice grains are smaller than the openings in the sieve's mesh, allowing them to fall through due to gravity."
0749-2,"**Answer:** Yes, the rice passes through the sieve. The yellow substance shown is a liquid (not a coarse grain), and it also passes through the sieve.

**Explanation:** The sieve has openings larger than the individual rice grains, allowing the rice to fall through when shaken. The yellow substance is a liquid, which flows freely through the sieve's mesh."
0749-3,"**No**, the flour does not pass through the sieve. The video shows the flour being scooped and successfully retained within the sieve's mesh basket."

0755-0,"The sponge is made of **cake**, an **edible material**.

**Explanation:** The video shows the person biting into the object that initially appears to be a cleaning sponge, revealing it has the texture and appearance of cake. This is consistent with other items shown later in the video (like the hand soap and bucket) which are also revealed to be hyperrealistic cakes."
0755-1,"The sponge shown in the video is a **hyperrealistic cake**.

It is made from edible materials such as cake batter, frosting, and likely fondant or food coloring to achieve the realistic appearance of a kitchen sponge, consistent with the video's theme of everyday objects revealed as cakes."
0755-2,"Yes, the sponge is edible, likely made of cake.

**Explanation:** The video shows the woman taking a bite out of the sponge. This action, combined with the later reveals of other everyday items (like the bowl of noodles and the cleaning bucket) being cakes, indicates the sponge is also a hyper-realistic cake designed to look like a cleaning tool."
0755-3,"**No.** The video context, including the action of the person biting the sponge and the subsequent reveals of other items (like noodles and a bucket) being cake, strongly indicates that the sponge is an edible replica designed to look like a synthetic one, rather than being made of actual polyurethane foam."

0763-0,"The can that was taken away is the real one.

**Explanation:** The hand physically picked up and removed that can, demonstrating it was a tangible, 3D object. This physical interaction wouldn't be possible with a flat, 2D drawing or illusion."
0763-1,"**Answer:** The **Removed Can** is genuine.

**Explanation:** The video demonstrates optical illusions created through drawings that appear three-dimensional. The narration explains that the eye can be tricked into perceiving these drawings as real objects. In the segment with the Coke cans (0:22-0:25), the can that remains is the drawing (the illusion), while the can that is temporarily brought into the frame and then taken away is the actual, physical object."
0763-2,"No, the can taken away was the duplicate used for the illusion. The original can remained on the table."
0763-3,"Yes, the canned Coke remaining in the picture is the real one. The video demonstrates an optical illusion where a second ""can"" (likely a drawing or prop) is made to look real from a specific angle but disappears when the hand moves, leaving only the original, real can."

0779-0,"**Illusion:** Penrose Triangle (Impossible Triangle)

**How it's achieved:** The video shows a physical 3D object designed to look like the classic Penrose Triangle, an impossible figure, but only when viewed from a specific angle. This is achieved through **forced perspective**. The object is constructed with gaps, specific angles, and disconnected parts that precisely align from the initial viewpoint, tricking the viewer's brain into perceiving continuous edges and a geometrically impossible structure. When the object is rotated, the alignment is broken, revealing its true, fragmented, and physically possible shape."
0779-1,"**Illusion:** The Penrose Triangle (also known as the Impossible Triangle).

**How it's created:** The illusion is achieved using a physical object and **forced perspective**. The orange object is not actually a single, continuous triangular structure made of cubes as it initially appears. It is cleverly constructed with specific breaks, gaps, and angled pieces. When viewed from one precise camera angle (the starting viewpoint), these separate components visually align perfectly, hiding the gaps and tricking the brain's depth perception into seeing a solid, geometrically impossible shape. Rotating the object reveals its true, disconnected structure and breaks the illusion."
0779-2,"**Yes**, the video shows a physical object designed to create the Penrose Triangle optical illusion. Initially, it appears as if it's made of nine interconnected orange cubes forming the impossible triangle. However, when the object is rotated, its true structure is revealed: it's a single piece with cleverly designed concave sections that only look like convex cubes from a specific viewing angle due to forced perspective."
0779-3,"Yes, the illusion is achieved by aligning separate blocks so they appear continuous from a specific angle. This is a perspective trick; when the object is rotated, the gaps and the actual non-continuous arrangement of the blocks are revealed, breaking the illusion of an impossible Penrose triangle. The specific angle hides the discontinuities and makes separate parts look joined, exploiting how our brain interprets 2D visual information to construct a 3D perception."

0790-0,"To see the blue tube, rotate the transparent sheet 90 degrees so it is held vertically, parallel to the blue tube.

**Explanation:** The video demonstrates that when the sheet is held horizontally (0:09-0:17), the blue tube underneath it disappears. When the sheet is rotated 90 degrees to a vertical orientation (0:18-0:23), the blue tube becomes fully visible through the sheet, while the horizontal red and green tubes disappear underneath it. This indicates the sheet is a polarizing filter, and aligning its polarization axis vertically (parallel to the blue tube) allows the blue tube to be seen."
0790-1,"To make the blue tube visible through the transparent sheet, the sheet needs to be **rotated 90 degrees** from its initial horizontal position to a **vertical orientation**, aligning it parallel to the blue tube."
0790-2,"**Yes.**

Rotating the sheet 90 degrees (from horizontal to vertical) aligns the polarizer's transmission axis to allow light associated with the vertical blue tube to pass through, making it visible, while blocking the light from the horizontal red and green tubes. This is demonstrated in the video between 0:18 and 0:23."

0794-0,"**Answer:**

The ""friend"" referred to in the caption is **the second cat (the white one with black spots/patches)**.

**Explanation:**

This cat is identified as the untrustworthy ""friend"" because it approaches the first cat and deliberately pushes it off the ledge, directly enacting the betrayal implied by the caption ""Never trust your friend 💀""."
0794-1,"The 'friend' described in the caption refers to **the dogs** waiting below the ledge.

**Explanation:** The caption ""POV: Never trust your friend"" is presented from the perspective of the cat. The cat jumps down from the ledge into the area where the dogs are waiting. This implies the cat might have jumped expecting safety or a friendly reception, but the presence of the dogs (potential predators or antagonists to a cat) suggests a betrayal of trust, making them the untrustworthy ""friends"" in this context."
0794-2,"Yes, the white cat that leaves quickly at the start of the video is the 'friend' referred to in the caption. Its abrupt departure just before the second cat makes the jump is presented as the untrustworthy act implied by the text ""Never trust your friend""."
0794-3,"Yes, the black dog is the 'friend' referred to in the caption.

**Explanation:** The video shows the cat jumping down, and immediately upon landing, the black dog begins to chase it. This action directly illustrates the caption ""Never trust your friend,"" implying the dog's chase is an act of betrayal or unexpected hostility towards the cat."

0816-1,"**Action:** The person held the bottle inverted and swirled/spun it.

**Explanation:** This swirling action created a vortex (or whirlpool) inside the bottle. The vortex formed an air core through the center, allowing air to enter the bottle continuously while water flowed out around the core, significantly speeding up the draining process compared to simply inverting the bottle."
0816-2,"Yes, the person spun the bottle in the second experiment.

This spinning motion created a vortex (a whirlpool) which allowed air to flow up through the center while water flowed down around the edges, significantly speeding up the emptying process compared to just inverting it without spinning."

0854-0,"The operator engages in conversation with the visitors primarily **to distract them and catch them off guard**. By engaging them in casual chat, sometimes even pretending there's a problem with the ride, he ensures they are mentally unprepared for the exact moment of the drop. This sudden activation, without warning or countdown, maximizes the element of surprise, intensifies the thrill and scare factor, and makes the ride experience more memorable."
0854-1,"The operator talks to the visitors primarily to **distract them and prevent them from mentally preparing for the drop**. By engaging them in casual conversation or even pretending there's an issue with the ride, the operator ensures the riders are caught completely off guard when the drop suddenly initiates. This maximizes the element of surprise, heightens the thrill and shock factor, and makes the experience more intense and unforgettable."
0854-2,"Yes, the operator talks to visitors to make them more nervous and scared.

**Explanation:** The video explicitly states that the operator chats with riders, sometimes even pretending the machine has a malfunction, and then suddenly activates the drop. This is done deliberately to catch the riders psychologically unprepared, thereby heightening their sense of surprise, nervousness, and fear, making the experience more intense and memorable."
0854-3,"No, the operator's conversation is not meant to help visitors feel more at ease or prepared.

**Explanation:** The video and text indicate the operator uses casual conversation, and sometimes even deception (like pretending there's a malfunction), specifically to distract the riders and catch them completely off guard when the ride suddenly drops. This tactic is designed to maximize the shock, surprise, and thrill of the experience, rather than to ease anxiety or allow for mental preparation."

0857-0,"**Answer:** The woman is imitating a plastic doll, specifically a Barbie doll, falling over.

**Explanation:** Her movements are intentionally stiff and lack natural bending when she falls both backward and forward. This mimics the way a rigid plastic doll with limited articulation would topple over. The accompanying music, Aqua's ""Barbie Girl,"" explicitly reinforces this interpretation with its lyrics about being a ""Barbie girl"" and ""life in plastic."""
0857-1,"Based on the video and the provided interpretations, the woman appears to be depicting:

**Playful tumbling and sliding down the sand dune, expressing freedom and childlike joy, potentially imitating the clumsy fall of a toy doll in connection with the ""Barbie Girl"" music.**

**Explanation:** Her actions involve repeated, exaggerated falls and slides down the steep dune, characteristic of recreational fun in such an environment. The movements convey a sense of carefree abandon and exuberance. The specific backward falls, combined with the chosen soundtrack, strongly suggest a playful imitation of a doll falling over."
0857-2,"No, the woman in the video is not imitating the experience of being shot.

**Explanation:** The video shows a woman playfully falling backward and then forward/sliding onto a large sand dune. Her movements are deliberate and appear recreational, consistent with tumbling or sliding down a sand dune for fun, rather than simulating the impact or reaction associated with being shot."
0857-3,"**Answer:** No

**Explanation:** The woman's falls are deliberate and controlled, involving active movements like leaning back significantly or diving forward onto the soft sand. Fainting is characterized by a sudden, involuntary loss of consciousness and muscle tone, resulting in a limp collapse. Her actions appear playful or performative rather than an imitation of fainting."

0858-0,"Based on the video and the accompanying text explanation, the man initially sat on the **right armrest** of the chair.

**Explanation:** The video's text overlay explicitly clarifies that although it might appear he sat on the left armrest due to the optical illusion, he actually made initial contact with the chair's **right armrest** before adjusting his position."
0858-1,"**Left armrest.**

**Explanation:** The video shows the man approaching the chair illusion and initially attempting to lower himself onto the structure on the viewer's left side, which corresponds to the perceived left armrest before the illusion is fully understood. The narration also mentions the perception that he sat on the left armrest first."
0858-2,"Yes, the man in the white short-sleeved shirt initially sat on the right armrest of the chair.

**Explanation:** The video's narration explains that while it appears the man sat on the left armrest due to the optical illusion created by the chair's design and the viewing angle, he actually sat on what is structurally the right armrest."
0858-3,"**Answer:** No, the man did not initially sit on the left armrest of the chair.

**Explanation:** The video's narration explains that while viewers might perceive him as sitting on the left armrest, due to the optical illusion nature of the chair, he actually sat on the right armrest."

0865-0,"At the end of the video, there are **two** worms visible on the ground. One is a brownish worm near the bird, and the other is a green worm slightly further away."
0865-1,"**Answer:** 2
**Explanation:** At the conclusion of the video, two creatures are visible on the ground: one brown worm near the bird and one green caterpillar further away."
0865-2,"**Answer:** No
**Explanation:** At the end of the video, there are two visible creatures: a longer, brownish worm near the wall crack and a shorter, greenish caterpillar/worm closer to the bird."
0865-3,"**Answer:** Yes, two worms are visible at the end of the video, but neither is actually *in* the bird's beak.

**Explanation:** The video ends with the baby bird holding its beak wide open directly above one worm lying on the ground, seemingly expecting it to enter. A second, similar-looking worm is visible nearby on the ground, slightly further away from the bird."

0870-0,"The man gave his belongings to the photographer because the interaction was likely staged for a social media video. He appears to be following instructions or prompts from the person filming as part of a script designed to evoke sympathy and highlight the subsequent act of charity (giving food, an umbrella, and money). His actions serve the video's narrative rather than reflecting a realistic response to the situation."
0870-1,"The man handed over his belongings because he was likely participating in a **staged or scripted video (#1, #6, #11, #21, #26, #31)**. He was **following the non-verbal instructions (pointing gestures) from the photographer (#4, #22)**, possibly with the **hope or understanding that complying with these requests would lead to receiving more substantial help or an exchange for better items (#2, #5, #9, #30)**, which ultimately occurred in the video's narrative."
0870-2,"**No.**

The man did not give his belongings (cardboard, hat) to the photographer. The photographer pointed at these items, prompting the man to put them aside, before providing him and the child with better alternatives (an umbrella) and other aid (food, money). The man and child were the recipients of help in the video, not the givers."
0870-3,"**No, the man did not give his belongings to the photographer in exchange for food and other necessities.**

**Explanation:** The video shows the photographer providing aid (food, drinks, an umbrella, and money) to the man and child who appear to be in need. The man did not trade his possessions (like his hat) for this help; rather, he was the recipient of charity from the photographer."

0871-0,A person picking up a pink object while being distorted by a video filter.
0871-1,"**A person, holding a pink object, being distorted and stretched vertically by a video effect.**

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows a human figure in the center of the road. This figure initially bends towards a pink, disc-like object before being subjected to a visual effect that dramatically stretches their form vertically until they seem to dissolve upwards."
0871-2,"**No.** This is not a chalk drawing. It is a video of a real person that has been digitally manipulated with a filter or effect, causing the figure to appear stretched and distorted as they bend towards a pink object in the road. Chalk drawings are static and do not move or distort in this manner."
0871-3,"No, the person is holding one pink, circular object, possibly a frisbee or a similar toy, in the middle of the road, not two bags."

0872-0,"**Left.**

**Explanation:** After placing the two packs of water bottles down, the man slides the upper pack horizontally towards the left side of the screen from the camera's perspective."
0872-1,"**Answer:** Right
**Explanation:** After placing the two packs of water bottles down (0:41-0:42), the man slides the top pack slightly towards the right side of the frame from the camera's viewpoint (0:43)."
0872-2,"Yes, the man moved the upper water bottle pack to the left after placing them down. He initially placed the two packs stacked vertically, then lifted the top pack and placed it on the ground to the left of the bottom pack, making them sit side-by-side."
0872-3,"Yes, the man moved the upper water bottle pack to the right after placing them down.

*   **Explanation:** At 0:41, the man places two packs of water bottles down next to the seated man. Immediately after, at 0:42, he adjusts the top pack by sliding it slightly to the right from the camera's perspective, likely to align it better or make it more stable on the bottom pack."

0875-2,"Yes, there are two cell phones visible on the piano. One phone with a light-colored case (possibly white or light blue with a MagSafe ring) is lying flat on the left side of the piano near the keyboard. Another phone with a solid green case is standing upright on the right side of the piano, near the end of the keyboard."

0879-0,"After the fourth second, the figures are all Lego minifigures, stationary on the same physical object (a Penrose triangle model), maintaining their relative positions to each other, and collectively participating in the optical illusion created by the object and the specific camera perspective."
0879-1,"Starting from the fourth second, the rotation reveals that the figures are **on separate, disconnected segments of the object** and **are *not* actually on a single, continuous plane or path** as the initial view suggested.

**Explanation:** The rotation breaks the optical illusion of the Penrose triangle. It becomes clear that the object is constructed from distinct parts, and each figure resides on one of these separate segments. The appearance of them being on the same continuous plane was dependent on the specific viewpoint before the rotation began."
0879-2,"Yes, the figure with the white head (on the left) and the figure with the black outfit (at the bottom) appear to be standing on the same plane due to the perspective of the optical illusion."
0879-3,"**No.** The object is a Penrose triangle, an optical illusion. The surfaces the figure in blue and the figure with the white head are standing on appear connected due to the specific viewing angle, but in the physical object creating the illusion, these surfaces are distinct and not on the same plane."
0879-7,Error
0880-0,"When the person holds up the structure with their hand, they apply a torque (rotational force) to the arrow. This causes the arrow, which is mounted on a pivot, to change from a static state (initially pointing to the right) to a rotating state. As it rotates around its vertical axis, the direction it points changes continuously."
0880-1,Error
0880-2,"Yes, the structure loses its directional illusion when the viewing angle changes significantly. The illusion relies on viewing the object's specific 3D geometry from a particular perspective (the 'front'). As demonstrated in the video when the base is rotated 180 degrees, viewing the object from the 'back' or a significantly different angle breaks the illusion, revealing a shape that no longer consistently appears to point in the same direction."
0880-3,"Yes, the reflection of the structure in the mirror appears to point in the opposite direction compared to the actual structure. This is due to the nature of reflection in a plane mirror, which causes lateral inversion (left-right reversal), and is enhanced by the specific 3D geometry of this ""ambiguous arrow"" object, designed to create this optical illusion."

0895-0,"**Answer:** The scene cut to is the **Chainsaw rim**.

**Explanation:** Immediately after the basketball goes through the mini hoop (around 0:07), the video transitions (at 0:08) to a scene featuring a basketball hoop modified with a chainsaw chain around the rim, accompanied by the text overlay ""chainsaw rim""."
0895-1,"Following the mini hoop shot, a man successfully makes a shot on a basketball hoop that has been modified with a running chainsaw chain rotating around the rim. This scene is labeled ""chainsaw rim"" in the video."
0895-2,"Yes.

**Explanation:** The video first shows a successful shot into a hoop labeled ""mini hoop"" (approximately 0:04-0:07). Immediately following this, the scene cuts to a shot being made into a hoop with a chainsaw attached to the rim, labeled ""chainsaw rim"" (approximately 0:07-0:09)."
0895-3,"**Yes.**

**Explanation:** The video first shows a shot attempt on a spiked hoop. Immediately following that clip, at approximately the 0:03 mark, the scene cuts to a person shooting a basketball into a mini hoop."
0895-7,A
0898-0,"**Answer:** Towards the center of the whirlpool.

**Explanation:** After the man throws the first pillow onto the floor effect, it lands on the swirling green ""water"" and is immediately carried by the simulated current inwards towards the central vortex/hole."
0898-1,"The man moved the first pillow away from himself and the couch, towards the right side of the screen."
0898-2,"**No**, the man did not move the first pillow closer to the camera after it was on the water. After throwing the first pillow, he immediately grabbed and threw the second pillow without interacting with the first one again until he stepped on it."
0898-3,"No. The first pillow lands on the left side of the whirlpool effect, and the man steps on it while it is still on the left side; he does not move it to the right."

0901-0,"**One.**

At the beginning of the video (0:00), there is one green rubber band stretched between the index finger and thumb of both hands."
0901-1,"**One rubber band.**

The video starts by showing a single green rubber band stretched between the index finger and thumb of both hands."
0901-2,"No, the hand is holding only one rubber band at the beginning. It is manipulated and twisted to create the illusion of two separate loops as part of the magic trick setup. The text overlay later confirms this by stating it is ""disguised as two rubber bands""."
0901-3,"Yes, the hand is holding only one rubber band at the beginning of the video. The video clearly shows a single green rubber band stretched between the thumb and index finger of each hand, forming one continuous loop."
0901-7,C
0905-0,"**Uphill.**

**Explanation:** At the beginning of the video, due to the specific camera angle used to create the optical illusion, the ramp where the marble is placed visually appears to slope upwards towards the center of the object."
0905-1,"**Decline.**

**Explanation:** Although the camera angle at the start creates an optical illusion making the ramp appear to slope upwards (incline) towards the center, the actual 3D object consists of four ramps that all physically slope downwards towards the central point. The marble is placed at the higher, outer end of one of these downward slopes (a decline), allowing gravity to pull it towards the lower center."
0905-2,"**Yes, the slope is downhill.**

**Explanation:** The video reveals that the object is a 3D-printed optical illusion. While it appears from the initial camera angle that the marble is rolling uphill, viewing the object from a different perspective shows that all four ramps physically slope downwards towards the center. The marble is simply following gravity and rolling down the actual slope to the lowest point."
0905-3,"No, the slope is not uphill. It is actually a downhill slope towards the center of the object. The appearance of an uphill slope at the beginning of the video is an optical illusion created by the specific camera angle."

0907-0,"**Answer:** The dog lands on **the grass**.

**Explanation:** After the man jumps on the plank, launching the dog into the air like a seesaw, the dog lands and tumbles on the green grass in the backyard."
0907-1,"**Answer:** The dog lands on the grass to the right of the seesaw.

**Explanation:** After the man jumps on the left side of the plank seesaw, the dog, which was on the right side, is launched into the air. Its trajectory takes it upwards and to the right, and it lands clearly on the grassy area in the backyard, tumbling slightly upon impact."
0907-2,"**No**, the dog lands on the grass next to the man, not directly on his body."
0907-3,"Yes, the dog lands on the grass. The video shows the dog being launched into the air by the makeshift seesaw and subsequently landing on the grassy lawn."

0910-0,"The man is repeatedly picking up the child as a form of **playfulness and entertainment (1, 6, 7, 12)**. It appears to be a game or a silly interaction meant to amuse the child, who likely **enjoys it and may even be requesting it (3, 22)**."
0910-1,"The man is repeatedly picking up the child as a form of **playful interaction**. It appears to be a game intended to entertain the child, make the walk more fun, and express affection, with the child seemingly enjoying the activity."
0910-2,"**Yes**, the man is likely picking up the child as part of a social experiment to see if anyone will intervene.

**Explanation:** The repetitive nature of the man picking up the child in the same location as different people pass by, the child's apparent calmness, and the man's occasional interaction with onlookers (like pointing) strongly suggest a staged scenario designed to observe public reactions, which is characteristic of a social experiment."
0910-3,"**No.**

The man picks up the child on the sidewalk and carries them along the pavement towards a building entrance, not into or across the street."
0910-7,D
0914-0,"The beer bottle is placed under the hot water faucet **to remove a heat-shrink wrapper or sleeve.**

**Explanation:** The video shows that the outer black and green layer on the bottle is a type of packaging, likely a plastic heat-shrink sleeve. The hot water causes this material to rapidly shrink and detach from the glass bottle, revealing the permanent label or design underneath. This is a specific feature of this type of packaging, using hot water as the intended removal method."
0914-1,"The purpose is to apply a heat-shrink sleeve label to the beer bottle. The hot water provides the necessary heat to cause the plastic sleeve to shrink and conform tightly to the shape of the bottle, effectively applying the label."
0914-2,"Yes, the video shows a beer bottle with a loose plastic sleeve being placed under a faucet labeled ""Hot Water."" When the water runs over the bottle, the plastic sleeve visibly shrinks and tightens, conforming to the bottle's shape."
0914-3,"**No**, the beer bottle is not placed under the faucet to demonstrate quick cooling. The faucet is explicitly labeled ""Hot Water"" (热开水), and the hot water is used to activate a heat-shrink sleeve or label, causing it to shrink and conform tightly to the bottle. This process actually heats the bottle, rather than cooling it."

0918-0,**Right hand:** The man holds the jar with his left hand and uses his right hand to pick up the soap shavings and place them into the jar.
0918-1,"**Answer:** The man places the soap into the box with his right hand.
**Explanation:** At the 0:05-0:06 mark in the video, the man holds the small clear container with his left hand (identifiable by the watch on his wrist) and uses his right hand to pick up a piece of the shaved blue soap and place it into the container. He repeats this action."
0918-2,"Yes, the man uses his right hand to put the soap shavings into the box. He holds the container with his left hand and uses his right hand to pick up the individual shavings and place them inside."
0918-3,"**No.**

**Explanation:** The man holds the clear container steady with his left hand while using his right hand to pick up the individual soap shavings and place them inside the container."

0919-0,"He colors a section of clear tape with markers in rainbow order (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple). He then shines his phone's flashlight through the colored tape onto a wall. The colored tape acts as a filter for the light, projecting the rainbow pattern onto the surface."
0919-1,"**Method:** The man colors clear tape with markers in rainbow stripes and then shines his phone's flashlight through the colored tape.

**Explanation:** The colored marker ink on the clear tape acts as a color filter. When the white light from the phone's flashlight passes through these colored sections, only light of that specific color is allowed through, projecting distinct colored beams onto the wall which form a rainbow pattern."
0919-2,"Yes, the man creates the rainbow effect by coloring stripes onto clear tape with markers and then shining a light (from his phone's flashlight) through the colored tape. The colored ink on the tape acts as filters, projecting the different colors onto the wall as a rainbow."
0919-3,"**No**, the man creates the rainbow effect by coloring clear tape with markers in rainbow stripes and then shining a light (like a phone flashlight) through the colored tape roll. This projects the colored stripes onto the surface, acting like a colored filter, rather than using a prism to refract and split white light into its spectrum."
0919-7,C
0924-0,"The red object in the hand of the woman in the white top (which she drops after being splashed) is a **red book**.

**Explanation:** The object is rectangular, has a red cover, and visible pages, and she was holding it in a manner consistent with reading before being splashed with blue liquid."
0924-1,The red item the woman in the white top is holding is a **book**. She was sitting in a chair reading it just before the blue liquid was thrown on her.
0924-2,"Yes, the woman in the white top is holding a red book. She is shown sitting in a chair reading the book with a red cover at 0:16, just before the blue liquid is thrown on her."
0924-3,"No, the woman in the white top is initially holding a red book, not a red bottle. At the end of the video, after being splashed with blue liquid, she is not holding anything."

0926-0,**Right hand:** This hand is pulling the thread taut across the palm to create the necessary tension for the needle eye to catch it through friction.
0926-1,"**Answer:** The **right hand** is used to pull the thread through the needle.

**Explanation:** In the video, the left hand holds the needle and rubs it against the thread held taut by the right hand across the left palm. Once the friction causes the thread to pass through the needle's eye, the right hand pulls the end of the thread completely through."
0926-2,"**No**, the right hand is not responsible for pulling the thread through the needle.

**Explanation:** The video shows the right hand holding the thread taut and relatively still across the palm. The left hand moves the needle back and forth across the thread, using friction and the resulting vibrations to guide the thread into the needle's eye. The primary action causing the threading is performed by the left hand manipulating the needle against the stationary thread held by the right hand."
0926-3,"**No**, the left hand holds the thread taut and stationary. The threading action results from the right hand moving the needle across the thread, utilizing friction."
0926-7,A
0927-0,"The man holds the child with his **left arm**.

**Explanation:** The video shows the man's left arm wrapped around the child's back and supporting their bottom, while his right arm is holding and interacting with the popsicle."
0927-1,"**Left arm:** The man is holding the baby with his left arm, which is wrapped around the baby's back and supporting their weight against his chest and shoulder. His right arm is primarily used to hold and interact with the popsicle."
0927-2,"Yes. The video clearly shows the man holding the baby with his left arm wrapped around the child for support, while his right hand is holding the red popsicle."
0927-3,"Yes, the man holds the child with his right arm while his left hand holds the popsicle."

The action shown is a prank where the mascot hits the woman in the face with a pie tin filled with whipped cream or a similar substance. The loud sound effect was likely added for comedic effect, but there is no visual evidence of any fire being lit."
0933-1,"Based on the video, the man in the costume did not start a fire. He hit the woman in the face with a pie tin filled with cream as a prank."
0933-2,"**Answer:** No, the man in the costume did not light a fire.

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows the mascot hitting the woman in the face with a pie tin filled with cream. The sounds heard (whistling/fuse and a bang) are added sound effects for comedic effect and do not represent an actual fire being lit. There is no visual evidence of flames, smoke, or any fire being used in the prank."

One person played all the roles (the three boys and the dad), as evidenced by the identical appearance of all characters."
0939-1,"**Answer:** 3
**Explanation:** There are three distinct individuals acting in the video. Initially, three young men are shown playing video games. Later, one of these individuals changes clothes and portrays the ""dad"" character who catches them. Therefore, only three unique people are acting."
0939-2,"**Yes,** it is true that only one person played all the roles in the video.

The facial features, build, and overall appearance of all the characters (the three boys and the 'dad') are identical, indicating the same actor portrayed everyone through costume changes and editing."

0942-1,"The man uses the side of the spatula primarily as a display of **skill and showmanship**, common in teppanyaki cooking. This technique allows for a **controlled and efficient** action, combining the catch and the crack into one fluid motion. The sharp edge provides a **precise point of impact** for a cleaner break directly onto the griddle, demonstrating dexterity and entertaining onlookers."
0942-2,"Yes, the man is demonstrating a teppanyaki cooking technique. He skillfully tosses the egg with a spatula and then catches it on the edge of the same spatula to break it onto the grill, which is a common flair move in teppanyaki performance cooking."
0942-3,"**No**, the man is not breaking the egg to show how fragile it is. He is demonstrating advanced teppanyaki cooking skills and showmanship, involving juggling the egg with spatulas before precisely cracking it to cook and create an artistic design (a heart with writing) on the griddle.

0949-1,"The company's boss appears in the video during these time segments:

1.  **0:00 - 0:35**: The boss is disguised as a blind beggar sitting on the street, testing the character of passersby who are later revealed to be job candidates.
2.  **0:53 - 0:59**: The boss enters the office, no longer in disguise, reveals his identity, explains that the street encounter was the real interview, and interacts with the candidates."
0949-2,"Yes, the man pretending to be a beggar at the start is revealed to be the boss later in the video. The video's premise is that the boss disguised himself as a blind beggar to test the character and kindness of potential employees before the formal interview."
0949-3,"**No.** The person revealed as the boss at the end (wearing a suit) is the same person shown from the beginning of the video disguised as a blind beggar in casual clothes.

Therefore, resonance does not occur, and the first tuning fork is not excited into significant vibration to move the ball."
0950-1,"**Answer:** The ball does not move.

**Explanation:** The second tuning fork vibrates at 240 Hz. This frequency does not match the natural frequency (260 Hz) of the first tuning fork next to the ball. Because the frequencies don't match, resonance does not occur, and the first tuning fork is not excited enough by the sound waves from the second fork to vibrate strongly and hit the ball."
0950-2,"**Yes**, the ball remains still.

**Explanation:** The second tuning fork vibrates at 240 Hz. This frequency does not match the natural frequency (260 Hz) of the first tuning fork next to the ball. Because the frequencies don't match, resonance does not occur, and the first tuning fork is not excited into significant vibration, leaving the ball undisturbed."
0950-3,"**No**, the ball does not move upwards.

**Explanation:** When the man strikes the second tuning fork, it vibrates at 240 Hz. This frequency does not match the natural frequency of the first tuning fork (260 Hz) next to the ball. Because the frequencies don't match, resonance does not occur, and the first tuning fork is not excited enough by the sound waves from the second fork to vibrate and move the ping pong ball."

0957-0,The substance (nylon) forming at the interface between the two liquids was pulled out as a continuous strand using tweezers and then wound onto the glass rod.
0957-1,"The process is **Interfacial Polymerization**, commonly known as the **Nylon Rope Trick**.

**Explanation:**
Two immiscible liquids, one containing a diamine (likely hexamethylenediamine dissolved in water) and the other containing a diacid chloride (like sebacoyl chloride dissolved in cyclohexane), are carefully layered. A chemical reaction called condensation polymerization occurs specifically at the interface (the boundary) where the two liquids meet. This reaction forms a thin film of nylon polymer. When this film is grasped with tweezers and continuously pulled upwards, fresh reactants from each layer are exposed at the interface, allowing the polymerization reaction to continue and forming a continuous strand or ""rope"" of nylon, which is then wound onto the glass rod."
0957-2,"Yes, the video shows the white, stringy substance being pulled from the interface of the liquids in the beaker using tweezers and then continuously wrapped around the glass rod."
0957-3,"No, the substance was formed by a chemical reaction occurring at the interface between the two liquids. It was then actively pulled out from this interface using tweezers and subsequently wound onto the glass rod for collection; it did not simply adhere to the rod when it was inserted."

**Explanation:** During the final challenge where they are throwing small objects at the large balloon clusters, MrBeast reacts multiple times between 0:41 and 0:45, exclaiming ""Ow!"", ""Ow!!"", and ""HURT!"" while flinching, indicating he was being hit by ricocheting projectiles. He stops the activity shortly after at 0:47 due to the injury."
0973-1,"**0:41-0:42**: The man in the gray hoodie reacts with ""Ow!"" at 0:41 and a more emphatic ""Ow!!"" at 0:42 while flinching and covering his head as projectiles are being thrown, indicating this is the moment he was hit."
0973-2,"Yes, the man in the gray hoodie on the left (MrBeast) got injured during the final balloon popping game.

**Explanation:** During the final segment where they were throwing objects at the hanging balloon clusters, one of the projectiles ricocheted and struck him on the forehead. The video shows him reacting in pain, saying ""Ow!"" and ""Hurt!"", and the final shots clearly show a bleeding cut on his forehead."
0973-3,"No, the man in the gray hoodie (MrBeast) did not get injured at the beginning of the video. He gets injured towards the end of the clip (around the 0:41 mark) when small objects they are throwing at hanging balloon clusters bounce back and hit him in the forehead, causing a cut. The beginning shows him starting the challenge without any injury."

0985-0,"**Answer:** No.

**Explanation:** The video clearly shows the woman removing the money from under the cup while the man holds it down. The money reappearing under the cup at the end is part of a magic trick or illusion, meaning it cannot be the same physical bill that was initially placed there and remained undisturbed."
0985-1,"**No**, the money is not in the cup at the end. The woman takes the money from under the cup while the man is looking down, and she is holding it in her hand when he lifts the cup the final time."
0985-2,"**No.** The rolled-up money is clearly visible on the table from the very beginning of the video, before the man places the cup over it."
0985-3,"No, the money did not stay in the cup. It was never actually inside the cup; the man placed the cup *over* the money on the table, and the woman sneakily took the money from the table while the man was shaking the cup above it."

0996-1,"The third timekeeping device featured is a **white paper circle with drawn hands**, representing a conceptual mechanical clock based on a pendulum mechanism."
0996-2,"Yes, the third timekeeping tool shown in the video is conceptually a pendulum clock.

**Explanation:** The character presenting the third device (a round face with hands) explicitly states, ""my concept will use a pendulum swing mechanism to create a constant movement in what I call 'hands'"". This description directly refers to the core operating principle of a pendulum clock."
0996-3,"**No.** The third timekeeping tool shown in the video is a representation of a mechanical clock with hands, presented by the character ""Mobohmad"". The sundial concept (black disc with a white gnomon using the sun's shadow) was the second tool presented."

1002-1,"He uses the baton held in his right hand, moving it downwards to intercept and catch the fourth falling stick."
1002-2,"**Answer:** No, the man did not use his foot to assist in catching the fourth stick.

**Explanation:** The video shows the man successfully catching the first three sticks with his hands. He fails to catch the fourth stick, which falls completely past his hand and hits the ground near his feet. He then bends down to pick the stick up off the floor with his hand after it has already landed. His foot does not interact with the stick to aid the catch itself."
1002-3,"**Answer:** No, the man did not catch the fourth stick with his right hand.
**Explanation:** He attempts to catch the fourth falling stick with his left hand; his right hand does not move towards that specific stick."

1009-0,"The man appears **disappointed** and **slightly dejected**.

**Explanation:** In both instances, after his attempts to share information about the art are politely declined (""I'm just looking thank you,"" ""Oh I'm ok thank you""), his initial enthusiastic expression fades, and he places his hands on his hips, looking momentarily let down or resigned that the visitors don't want to engage in a discussion about the art. His enthusiasm is visibly dampened."
1009-1,"Based on the video:

In the first two scenes, after the visitor politely declines his attempt to discuss the art, the man **accepts their refusal, puts his hands on his hips, looks down briefly, and steps back slightly, appearing slightly disappointed or resigned** after his initial enthusiasm to talk about the art is not reciprocated."
1009-2,"No, the man does not seem disappointed and walk away.

**Explanation:** The visitor does not wave at the man in the first two scenes; she verbally declines his attempt to discuss the art. In response, the man does not walk away but remains nearby, politely accepting her preference to look on her own without showing strong disappointment."
1009-3,"Yes, the man appears enthusiastic and eager to engage. In both scenes, he proactively approaches the visitors, initiates conversation about the specific artworks they are viewing, uses hand gestures, and smiles, indicating a clear desire to share information and interact."

He had actually made a Rice Krispies treat, covered it in blue frosting to look like the sponge she was using, and bit into that instead. She reacted out of shock and disgust, thinking he had bitten the real sponge."
1011-1,"The woman sprayed the man with the hose because he bit into an object that looked exactly like a blue kitchen sponge. Her immediate reaction was one of shock and disgust, as she believed he was eating a dirty, unsanitary cleaning tool. This was the culmination of a prank he set up, where he substituted the real sponge with a lookalike food item (a Rice Krispie treat covered in blue frosting) to elicit this exact response."
1011-2,"Yes, the woman sprayed the man with the hose because she was pranked into believing he had put the actual blue cleaning sponge into his mouth and was eating it. Her shocked reaction (""Oh my god!"") and immediate use of the water suggest she thought he was consuming the sponge (potentially with soap) and reacted out of panic or concern. The video later reveals it was a prank involving a lookalike treat."

1018-0,"**Answer:**

The rapper reacted calmly, cooperatively, and patiently.

**Explanation:**

Upon the traffic controller taking the microphone, the rapper immediately stopped performing. He appeared momentarily surprised but remained calm and non-confrontational, offering no resistance. He waited patiently on the speaker while the controller made his safety announcement and then peacefully took the microphone back to resume his performance."
1018-1,The rapper seemed surprised initially but quickly reacted calmly and with amusement. He smiled while the traffic controller used the microphone for a safety announcement and waited patiently without confrontation before taking the microphone back.

**Explanation:** When the mom turns the baby to face the dad, the baby looks directly at him with wide eyes but does not smile or show the same excited reaction seen when interacting with the mom or big brother. The expression is calm and observant, but lacks overt enthusiasm."
1020-1,"When the baby sees their father, they look directly at him with a neutral, calm, and relatively expressionless face. The baby does not smile, laugh, or show visible signs of excitement, simply observing the father quietly."
1020-2,"Yes, the baby does show a lack of excitement when seeing the dad. The baby looks at the dad with a neutral expression, unlike the clear excitement shown when reaching for the mom and smiling/laughing at the big brother."
1020-3,"**No**, the baby does not react with excitement and joy when seeing their dad. The baby looks at the dad with a relatively neutral or slightly curious expression, without smiling, laughing, or reaching out like they do for the mom or big brother."

**Explanation:** His eyes widen progressively, he looks around as if unable to comprehend the situation, and ultimately covers his mouth as the bids for the banana artwork reach millions, mirroring the ordinary banana he holds."
1031-1,"The man is experiencing **Shock, Disbelief, and Amazement**.

**Explanation:** His facial expressions, including wide eyes, an open mouth, and leaning forward intently, clearly show he is stunned and finds it difficult to comprehend the incredibly high auction prices being bid for an artwork that appears to be just a banana taped to a wall, similar to the one he is casually holding."
1031-2,"Yes, the man in the white shirt is clearly surprised and shocked by the banana auction.

His facial expressions escalate from curiosity to wide-eyed disbelief and astonishment as the bids for the banana artwork climb into the millions. His body language, including leaning forward, looking around incredulously, and eventually covering his mouth, along with his hasty exit after the final bid, all confirm his shock at the extraordinary price achieved by the artwork."

Their **attention is immediately captured** by the intense game sounds, forcing **rapid cognitive reorientation** and **information processing** as they instinctively initiate **engagement** with the game controller."
1044-1,"Based on the video, the person under the quilt appears **Startled, Surprised, Confused, and Shocked.**

**Explanation:** He was abruptly woken from sleep by loud video game sounds played directly into his ears via headphones placed on him without his knowledge. His wide-eyed, frozen expression at the end clearly indicates he was startled by the noise and is surprised and confused about the unexpected situation he woke up to, likely feeling shocked by the prank."
1044-2,"Yes, the person under the quilt is surprised and confused. They were woken up abruptly from sleep by loud gaming sounds played through a headset placed on them, while also finding a controller in their hands, leading to a visibly startled and bewildered reaction with wide eyes."
1044-3,"**Yes**, the person under the quilt becomes deeply engrossed in the video game.

**Explanation:** Although initially asleep, the moment the headphones are placed on them and the game sounds start, they immediately wake up, grip the controller actively, and focus intently forward (presumably at a screen), indicating a rapid shift into engrossment with the game."

1045-0,"The person on the left hugs the person in the tie-dye hoodie primarily **to comfort him after his extreme shock** from the prank reveal and simultaneously **to manage the situation and control the narrative** as their mother walks into the room. The hug serves to physically stabilize the younger boy (who leaned back dramatically), offer reassurance, and prevent him from immediately complaining or showing distress to the mother while the older boy claims they are ""having a great time."" He lets go once the initial shock and the need to manage the mother's entrance subside."
1045-1,"The person on the left embraces the individual in the tie-dye hoodie primarily **to reassure and comfort him** after the startling prank reveal, signaling that the apparent injury was fake and just a joke. The embrace also serves to **manage the younger person's shocked reaction** and potentially **present a scene of playful interaction rather than distress** as their mother walks into the room."
1045-2,"Yes, the older brother hugged the younger one to prevent their mother from discovering he fainted.

**Explanation:** After the older brother revealed the prank (fake blood/injury), the younger brother reacted by appearing to faint. The older brother immediately grabbed him just as their mother walked into the room. He held the younger brother upright while reassuring their mother that they were ""having a great time,"" clearly attempting to hide the fainting incident."
1045-3,"**No.**

**Explanation:** The hug was not a mutual celebration. The video shows the older boy performing a prank involving a fake, gruesome hand injury, which causes the younger boy to react with extreme shock and distress. The older boy initiates the hug immediately after the reveal, seemingly as a way to manage the younger boy's reaction or express his own amusement at the successful prank, rather than as a shared celebration of the trick itself. The younger boy's visible shock and subsequent slumping onto the table clearly indicate he was not celebrating."

1046-1,"**Answer:** Retaliation/Payback.

**Explanation:** The person in the gray T-shirt (who was wearing a black shirt at the start) initiated the interaction by pushing the person in the black hat into the pool. The person in the black hat then got out, chased him down, and pushed him into the pool in return as direct payback or retaliation for the initial push."
1046-2,"Yes, the person in the black hat threw the person in the grey T-shirt into the pool as retaliation. The video shows the person (initially wearing a black shirt, later a grey one) pushing the man in the hat into the pool first. The man in the hat then gets out, confronts the person who pushed him, and throws them into the pool in return."
1046-3,"**No, the person in the gray T-shirt was thrown into the pool as retaliation.**

The video shows that the person in the gray T-shirt (who was initially wearing a black shirt) first pushed the man in the black hat into the pool as a prank. The man in the hat then got out, chased him down, and threw him into the pool as playful payback or retaliation for the initial prank."

1049-0,"The action serves as a setup for the Khaby Lame meme by portraying an unnecessary and inappropriate action (hitting the dog with a slipper). It represents a questionable or overly complex/harsh response, possibly stemming from frustration or intended as poor discipline, primarily functioning as the ""problem"" or trigger for Khaby's silent critique or reaction, which is the core of the meme."
1049-1,"The intention appears to be **cueing or directing the dog** as part of a **staged skit or video sequence**. The light hit with the slipper serves as a physical prompt to make the dog move from its bed onto the person's bed, likely as a planned action needed to progress the scene for the video before cutting to the final clip."
1049-2,"Yes, the person taps the dog with a slipper, which appears to be the cue or command for the dog to get up, walk to the light switch, and turn off the lights."
1049-3,"Based on the visual evidence, **no, it is unlikely the person was expressing significant frustration or annoyance.**

**Explanation:** The action appears to be a very light tap with the slipper, more akin to a gentle prompt or cue for the dog to move. The dog gets up calmly without signs of fear or pain. The person's actions lack the force, speed, or aggressive body language typically associated with hitting out of strong frustration or annoyance."

1051-0,"The man bites his hand as a physical expression of being overwhelmed by positive emotions.

**Explanation:** This gesture likely combines several feelings triggered by sitting on his 95-year-old grandfather's lap, possibly recreating a childhood photo:
*   **Overwhelmed Affection & Nostalgia:** Intense love and fond memories flooding back.
*   **Playful ""Cuteness Aggression"":** Similar to wanting to squeeze something adorable, it's a reaction to the heartwarming sweetness of the moment.
*   **Containing Emotion:** A way to playfully manage or express immense joy, tenderness, or even the urge to laugh or cry from happiness."
1051-1,"The man in black is biting his hand to playfully recreate the pose he held as a baby in the photograph shown immediately after, where he is being held by the same older man. This gesture serves as a direct visual link connecting the present moment to their shared past captured in the photo."
1051-2,"Yes, the man in black is mimicking his childhood action shown in the photo by bringing his hand to his mouth.

**Explanation:** The video first shows the man sitting on the older man's lap and bringing his hand towards his mouth while laughing. It immediately transitions to a childhood photo where he, as a baby held by the same man (visibly younger), has his hand in or near his mouth. The sequence and similarity in action strongly suggest a deliberate mimicry or recreation of the moment captured in the photograph."
1051-3,"**Yes:** The gesture, combined with the smile and the context of playfully sitting on his elderly grandfather's lap, likely signifies being overwhelmed by affectionate, sentimental feelings in the present moment. It's a physical manifestation of intense positive emotion, like love and tenderness, deeply rooted in their long relationship, which the subsequent photo emphasizes nostalgically."

1053-1,"The man lifts his hat to reveal his face and engage with his friend seated next to him. This action, accompanied by a smile, serves as a friendly greeting or acknowledgement, possibly in a playful manner, allowing him to make eye contact and show he is ready to interact."
1053-2,"**Yes:** The man in the black T-shirt is manipulating a dark garment (a hoodie/jacket, not a hat) over the middle seat, pulling it up as people walk by, seemingly to give the impression that the seat is taken or reserved, thus deterring others from sitting there."
1053-3,"**No:** The man appears to be adjusting his hood or reacting playfully during a conversation with the person seated next to him. His focus and smile are directed towards his seatmate, indicating the gesture is part of their interaction, not an acknowledgement of a passerby."
1053-7,A
1055-0,"**Answer:** **None / Absence of Reason**

**Explanation:** The video primarily depicts an accident resulting from impulsive and careless behavior (putting a hand in a running blender). This action directly contradicts the core Enlightenment value of **reason**, which emphasizes logic, foresight, and rational decision-making as the primary guide for human action. Instead, the video highlights human fallibility and the negative consequences of acting without thinking, serving as a contrast to, rather than an example of, Enlightenment ideals."
1055-1,"**Best Takeaway:** Blender Safety is Crucial: Always ensure appliances like blenders are unplugged before putting hands or objects inside, especially near the blades, to prevent serious injury.

**Explanation:** The video vividly shows the dangerous outcome of placing a hand inside a blender while it is still powered on. The sudden activation causes a violent reaction and highlights the potential for severe injury due to the sharp, fast-moving blades, emphasizing the necessity of unplugging the appliance before any internal interaction."
1055-2,"No, the video does not have high enlightenment value. The humor stems from a prank resulting in an accident and potential harm, which provides shock value or superficial amusement rather than the profound insight or deeper understanding associated with enlightenment."
1055-3,"Yes, the enlightenment value is low because the video primarily depicts a messy prank/accident involving ketchup and a blender, prioritizing shock value and entertainment over significant educational, intellectual, or insightful content."

1064-0,"The man is surprised because the fuse on the large firecracker burned down completely, but the expected explosion didn't happen immediately. He had run away and then returned, crouching very close to the actively sparking firecracker just as the fuse finished, making the unexpected delay and his proximity to the imminent blast the cause of his shock."
1064-1,"The man is surprised because the firecracker, labeled ""BOMB,"" had a significantly delayed fuse. After running a long distance expecting a large explosion and seeing nothing happen, he likely assumed it was a dud and returned to investigate. He was then caught completely off guard when the firecracker finally produced a small, anti-climactic burst of sparks right next to him, contrasting sharply with both the expected large explosion and the assumption that it had failed entirely."
1064-2,"Yes, the man is surprised because the video is edited to humorously show him running a long distance away from the lit firework, only to inexplicably reappear right next to it as it's about to explode. His surprise is a reaction to this illogical situation created by the editing, where his attempt to reach safety seemingly failed, placing him back in immediate danger."
1064-3,"Yes, the man is surprised because the firework exploded unexpectedly close to him.

**Explanation:** Although he lit the firework himself, he ran away initially but then returned and crouched very near the actively sparking firework. His shocked reaction (wide eyes, open mouth, grabbing his head) when it detonated right beside him clearly indicates he was surprised by the timing and proximity of the explosion after returning."

1081-1,"The small green bricks represent mouthwash.

**Explanation:** In the video's demonstration of a Lego oral hygiene routine, the green bricks are poured from a container into the mimic's mouth, shaken to simulate swishing, and then spat out, visually representing the use of mouthwash to rinse the mouth between flossing and brushing.

1087-0,"**Answer:** The circle on the left **appears** to move in the direction indicated by the arrow inside it (which changes constantly), but it is **actually stationary**.

**Explanation:** This is an optical illusion. The changing direction of the arrow tricks the brain into perceiving motion in the static circle. When the arrow is ignored or covered, it becomes clear the circle itself is not moving."
1087-1,Error
1087-2,"Yes, it is true that the left circle does not actually move. The perceived movement is an optical illusion caused by the rotating arrow inside the circle, which tricks the brain into interpreting the static circle as being in motion."
1087-3,"**No.** The circle on the left does not actually move. It remains stationary, and the perceived motion in the direction of the arrow is an optical illusion created by the changing arrow direction and the color gradient within the ring."

1090-1,"Based on the video, the painting on the ground appears to the sheep as **a physical barrier or obstacle with depth, like a hole or a series of gaps under a structure.**

**Explanation:** The sheep clearly hesitate and refuse to walk over the painted area, instead choosing to go around it. This avoidance behavior indicates they perceive the 2D drawing as a 3D impediment or hazard, successfully fooled by the optical illusion into seeing something unsafe or impassable directly in their path."
1090-2,"Yes, the painting on the ground appears to look like a broken bridge or a hole to the sheep.

This slow, controlled movement allows him to precisely place the cutout, find a stable anchor point on the riverbed without it falling over, minimize water disturbance for a clearer image, and handle the delicate paper gently."
1101-2,"Yes, the man is seen gradually submerging the stick that holds the paper cutout. This action is performed to position the figure for the final shot, creating an illusion of it emerging from the water."
1101-3,"**No.**

**Explanation:** The primary purpose of slowly submerging the paper was likely **symbolic and visual**, not merely to get it wet. The slow, careful action mimics the reverence of a religious ritual (like Visarjan, the immersion of deities) and allows for controlled placement to capture a visually appealing shot for the video, possibly making it appear to float momentarily or enter the water gracefully. While getting wet is an outcome, the *slowness* points towards achieving a specific aesthetic and respectful handling."

The explosion then occurs inside the structure where the man in the blue shirt hid, confirming he took the firework with him. The narration also explicitly states, ""Turns out, his friend had taken the firework."""
1112-1,"**Answer:** The man in the blue shirt picked up the firework instead of the lighter.

**Explanation:** The video shows both men running away after setting up the firework under the bucket. The man in the blue shirt runs into the small brick building. When the man in the pink shirt checks the bucket, only the lighter remains. The narration confirms ""his friend"" (the man in blue) took the firework. Finally, the man in the blue shirt emerges from the building covered in soot, indicating the firework went off while he was inside with it."
1112-2,"Yes, the person in the blue shirt took the firework instead of the lighter.

**Explanation:** The video shows the man in the blue shirt running into the building after setting up the device. His friend in the pink shirt later finds only the lighter under the bucket, indicating the firework was removed. The narration confirms, ""his friend had taken the firework."" Finally, the man in blue emerges from the building covered in soot after an explosion clearly happened inside with him, confirming he took the firework."

1117-2,"Yes, the person in the blue shirt caused the water to overflow and failed the challenge. Their addition of water broke the surface tension that was holding the water above the rim, leading directly to the spill."
1117-3,"No, the person in the red shirt did not fail the challenge. The video shows the person in the red shirt successfully adding water without spilling on their turn (around 0:40-0:45). The water overflowed on the subsequent turn when the person in the blue shirt added more water (around 0:49)."

**Explanation:** When the person in red reacted to the virtual image hitting him (the startle), the bowl was knocked from his lap into the air, spilling popcorn, before landing on the floor near the couch as he fell."
1119-1,"**Answer:**

The bowl is **on the floor, amidst the spilled popcorn, near the couch** when the person in red responds.

**Explanation:**

The person in red was startled when the phone image appeared to fly towards him, causing him to throw the bowl of popcorn into the air and fall off the couch. By the time he responds to the image (0:08-0:10), both he and the bowl have landed on the floor, surrounded by the scattered popcorn."
1119-2,"Yes, the bowl is on the floor under the oversized phone screen when the person in red reacts.
*   **Explanation:** The person in red is holding the bowl while sitting on the couch. When the oversized phone screen effect appears, it knocks the person onto the floor, causing them to drop the bowl and spill the popcorn. The bowl lands on the floor in the same area where the phone screen effect is displayed, appearing visually underneath or within the boundaries of the large screen graphic."
1119-3,"Yes, the bowl is on the lap of the person in red when they react. The video shows them holding the bowl on their lap just before the visual effect happens, and their startled reaction involves falling backward, which causes the bowl to fly off their lap and spill the popcorn."

1124-0,"**Answer:** The egg is **inside the water bottle**.

**Explanation:** When the performer swiftly hit the bottle sideways, the bottle moved out from under the egg. Due to inertia, the egg resisted the sideways motion and remained momentarily suspended in the air before gravity pulled it straight down into the bottle's opening."
1124-1,"When the performer strikes the egg, the shell breaks and is knocked away. Due to inertia, the egg's contents (yolk and white) resist the sudden horizontal motion and continue their downward path due to gravity, falling directly into the opening of the water bottle."
1124-2,"No, the egg falls *into* the water bottle. Due to inertia, the egg resists the quick sideways motion applied to the bottle and is pulled straight down into the opening by gravity once its support is removed."
1124-3,"Yes, the egg ended up inside the water bottle. The performer applied quick downward pressure on the egg, forcing it through the opening and into the bottle."

1130-0,"**Answer:** Red
**Explanation:** The older man's largest arm swing is directed towards a mechanism at the base of the red ball's stand. This action triggers the launch of the red ball upwards and to the right, causing it to move significantly more than the stationary blue and green balls."
1130-1,"**The red ball** showed the most movement.

**Explanation:** Being suspended freely like a pendulum, the red ball was much more sensitive to the air disturbance or vibrations caused by the man's arm swing, allowing it to swing with a significantly larger amplitude compared to the blue and green balls fixed on stands."
1130-2,"**No**, the red ball did not move significantly. It exhibited only a very slight wobble, while the blue ball, which was the target of the man's action, swung wildly."
1130-3,"Yes, the blue ball moved significantly when the old man swung his arm. The swing appears directed towards the blue ball's apparatus, and the video shows the blue ball swinging outwards with considerable amplitude as a direct result of this action."

1134-0,"The ball travels in an arc, hits the upper part of the backboard, and rebounds outwards, away from the rim. As the ball descends after the bounce, the person pulls the entire hoop structure downwards and forwards, tilting it. The ball then falls through the net because the hoop was manually moved into its path."
1134-1,"The ball traveled in an **upward arc** following a **parabolic path** towards the backboard. It ascended after release and then descended towards the point of impact high on the backboard, consistent with **projectile motion** under gravity."
1134-2,"No, the ball did not bounce back to the person after hitting the rim in the last scene. It hit the rim and bounced away to the left side, falling onto the grass away from the thrower."
1134-3,"**No**, the ball did not descend directly towards the hoop. It descended well short and to the left of the hoop, landing on the grass."
1134-7,B
1137-0,"**Answer:** Upwards.

**Explanation:** When the woman is upside down, the man's head is tilted back, and he is looking up towards the woman's legs/feet that he is holding."
1137-1,"**Downwards, towards the woman and child beneath him.**

**Explanation:** When the woman is upside down (bent over at the waist) and the man is doing a handstand supported by her, his body is inverted. Consequently, his head and gaze are oriented downwards towards the ground, which is also the direction of the woman and child who are below him in this formation."
1137-2,"**No**, when the woman is upside down, the man is also upside down performing a handstand on her, so his head is facing downwards towards the ground."
1137-3,"**Yes.** When the woman is bent over/upside down, the man performs a flip and ends up in an inverted position on her back, with his head clearly facing downward towards the ground."

1169-1,"The effect was created using **video editing**. A **hidden cut** or **jump cut** was made at the moment the ball approached the man. During the edit, the actor was removed and replaced with his clothes, shoes, hat, and extra soccer balls before the video resumed, creating the illusion of him shattering."
1169-2,"**Yes**, the effect of the man in the black and white clothes appearing to be ""kicked to pieces"" is achieved through video editing effects. It's a visual gag where the man is edited out at the moment of impact, and multiple copies of his clothes and soccer balls are edited in to create the illusion of him exploding."

1170-0,"The containers disappeared through **video editing and visual effects (VFX)**.

**Explanation:** The instantaneous vanishing of the large stack of containers, while the rest of the scene remains unchanged, is physically impossible. This effect was achieved digitally in post-production by editing the video footage to remove the containers from the frames after they were shown being stacked."
1170-1,"The containers vanished due to **video editing and visual effects (VFX)**.

**Explanation:** The instantaneous disappearance of the containers defies physics and is clearly an artificial effect added during post-production using digital manipulation techniques to create a visual gag, likely mimicking the game Tetris."
1170-2,"Yes, the containers disappear because they were part of a Tetris-like game simulation created using post-production effects. The way the containers instantly vanish when a horizontal row is completed is not physically possible and directly mimics the line-clearing mechanic in the game Tetris, indicating digital manipulation was used after filming."

1173-0,"The person disappeared as part of a planned visual effect or stunt. This was achieved through video editing, where a cut or digital removal occurred precisely at the moment of the large water splash, using the splash to mask the transition and create the illusion of vanishing."
1173-1,"**Answer:** The person vanished due to video editing.

**Explanation:** The sudden disappearance coincides exactly with the splash of the drinks. This indicates a cut or jump cut in the video editing process, where the footage of the person was removed and replaced with footage of the empty, messy seat immediately after the splash began. The chaos of the splash helps mask the edit point."
1173-2,"**Answer:** Yes, the person likely disappeared due to post-production editing.

**Explanation:** The person's disappearance is instantaneous and coincides perfectly with the splash of liquid, which acts as a visual disruption. It is physically implausible for a person to vanish completely from the frame that quickly during such a chaotic event. The most logical explanation is the use of video editing techniques, such as a jump cut (cutting from the shot with the person to a shot without them) hidden by the splash, or digital removal of the person from the frames after the splash begins."
1173-3,"**No, the person didn't disappear.** The sudden stop or bump caused the numerous drinks they were holding to fly forward and upward due to inertia, splashing liquid and throwing cups everywhere, which obscured the person from view."

1175-1,"The technique used is **CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery) / Visual Effects (VFX)** combined with **Digital Compositing** and **3D Animation**.

**Explanation:** A digital 3D model of the polar bear was created and animated using computer software. This animated CGI bear was then digitally added (composited) into the live-action footage of the street scene in post-production, replacing or overlaying the chalk drawing to create the illusion of it coming to life and moving. Camera tracking was likely used to ensure the CGI bear stayed correctly positioned within the scene as the camera moved."
1175-2,"Yes, the bear's transformation from a pavement drawing into a seemingly real, moving creature is achieved through clever editing and visual effects (VFX/CGI). The initial chalk art likely serves as a practical element or digital marker, which is then seamlessly replaced or augmented in post-production with an animated 3D bear to create the illusion of it coming to life."
1175-3,"**No, the bear on the ground is not a mechanical bear.**

1176-0,The plant didn't actually grow larger. The effect was created using video editing. The scene cuts from the man holding a small plant outside a small greenhouse to a different scene inside a much larger location (likely a botanical garden or studio) where a giant prop version of the plant was already placed.
1176-1,"The plant appeared larger due to **video editing** (specifically a **cut/scene change**) combined with **special effects (VFX)**, likely involving **prop substitution** or **Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI)**. The video cuts from the man holding a small plant outside to a different scene inside where a giant version of the plant is shown."
1176-2,"Yes, the plant appears larger due to post-production video editing techniques. The transition from the small greenhouse exterior to the vast interior, followed by the instantaneous and impossible growth of the Venus flytrap, are clear indicators of digital manipulation and visual effects."
1176-3,"No, the plant in the man's hand did not grow larger due to a change in perspective. The video uses editing or a visual effect, masked by the doorway transition, to switch from the scene with the small plant to a different scene featuring a separate, giant plant prop or effect."

1177-0,"The man appeared on the boat through **video editing**.

**Explanation:** As the man himself hints (""No, it's like, it's edited""), a simple video cut (jump cut) was likely performed. The camera stopped recording just as the towel fully obscured him on the dock and started recording again showing him already standing on the boat. The towel served as a visual obstruction to hide this edit seamlessly."
1177-1,"**Answer:** A **Jump Cut** masked/hidden by the water splash.

**Explanation:** The video uses a common editing technique. One shot shows the man jumping into the water, creating a splash. The video is then cut at the peak of the splash, and a second, separate shot begins, showing the man already on the boat further away. The visual disruption of the splash helps hide the abrupt transition (the jump cut) between the two different takes, creating the illusion of instantaneous movement."
1177-2,"**Answer:** Yes, the man appearing on the boat is due to video editing and visual effects.

**Explanation:** The transition where the man disappears from the dock as the towel drops and instantly reappears on the boat further away is physically impossible in real-time. This instantaneous change in location is a common visual effect achieved through video editing, likely using a cut masked by the falling towel to seamlessly join two separate shots (one on the dock, one on the boat)."
1177-3,"**No**, he didn't swim to the boat as part of the trick. He used the towel as a distraction or cover before jumping into the water from the dock, and then appeared on the boat almost instantly, suggesting a magic trick or video edit rather than swimming the distance."

The filter captures the image line by line; it records the bottom half of the phone while it's flat, and then records the top half after it has been folded up, creating the visual illusion of an open laptop."
1178-1,"The laptop shape appears because the person uses the time warp scan filter and physically tilts the smartphone upwards (mimicking opening a laptop) as the scan line moves across it. This timed movement distorts the phone's image, creating the visual illusion of a laptop as the final transformation shown in the video sequence."
1178-2,"**Yes**, the ""laptop"" in the final scene is the original smartphone transformed by a visual effect filter.

**Explanation:** The moving vertical cyan line indicates a ""time warp scan"" or ""slit-scan"" filter is active. This filter distorts the image based on how objects move relative to the scanning line. By tilting and moving the smartphone as the line passes, its image is warped to create the illusion of it being bent into a laptop shape."
1178-3,"**No**, the ""laptop"" in the final scene is not a foldable device unfolding from a smartphone. It is the original smartphone being distorted by the **time warp scan filter** effect used in the video, creating the visual illusion of it unfolding into a laptop shape as the filter line passes over the moving phone."

1183-1,"Based on the video's narrative, the sky becomes dark because the character reaches out and seemingly grabs the sun, condensing it into a small glowing orb he holds in his hands, thus removing the primary source of daylight. This effect was achieved through video editing and visual effects."
1183-2,"**Yes.** The sky darkens instantaneously as the character ""catches"" the sun, transforming it into a handheld orb. This rapid, physically impossible change from bright daylight to night seen through the window, coupled with the visual effect of the orb, clearly indicates the use of post-production effects combined with controlled lighting changes within the room."
1183-3,"**No.** The sky darkened because the video depicts the person magically pulling the sun out of the sky and holding it as a glowing orb, which caused the scene outside the window to instantly change from day to night. This was a visual effect representing the removal of the sun, not the result of turning off lights inside the room."

1192-0,"The standing sprinkler suddenly appeared because it was added digitally using visual effects (VFX/CGI) in post-production. This effect was created to simulate the ""Topiary Sprinkler"" weapon from the Ratchet & Clank video game, which the character references and holds a prop replica of, making it seem as though the toy weapon summoned the sprinkler."
1192-1,"The sudden appearance of the standing sprinkler was caused by **visual effects (VFX) and video editing**.

**Explanation:** The sprinkler is not physically present; it was digitally created (likely using CGI) and added into the video footage during post-production using editing and compositing techniques to make it appear instantly when the person ""fires"" the toy weapon. This creates the illusion seen in the video, characteristic of creators like Zach King."
1192-2,"Yes, the standing sprinkler's sudden appearance in the video is due to creative video editing. It instantly materializes in the scene when the person ""fires"" their toy weapon, which isn't physically possible without editing and indicates it was digitally added in post-production."
1192-3,"**Yes, the sprinkler appears suddenly from the ground immediately after the thrown object lands.** The timing and location strongly suggest the object's landing triggered the sprinkler to pop up from a hidden position, likely underground."

1203-0,"He twisted the ends of the towel in opposite directions. This twisting action caused the fabric under the stream to tighten, bunch up, and lift away from the direct path of the water, allowing him to remove it without pulling it through the stream."
1203-1,"The man twisted the towel tightly into a thin rope-like shape at the section directly under the water stream. He then pulled the twisted section out quickly and horizontally, minimizing the surface area and the time the towel spent under the water flow, thus preventing it from getting wet."
1203-2,"Yes, the man (Andrey) successfully removed the towel. He achieved this by taking the loose ends of the towel and lifting them up and over the faucet spout, which effectively unlooped the towel and allowed it to come free from the faucet."
1203-3,"**Yes**, the man detached the spray head from its holder and used the head itself to hook and pull the towel out from under the main stream of water, thus avoiding getting his hands wet from the primary flow."
1203-7,B
1206-0,"**Answer:** The video is played in reverse.

**Explanation:** The paint was likely splashed or poured downwards onto the man's face and the wall. Reversing the video footage creates the illusion that the paint is flying upwards out of the can, seemingly defying gravity, which aligns with the ""Gravity 😑"" text overlay."
1206-1,"The paint appears to spill upwards because the scene is filmed with the person and camera inverted (upside down). Gravity is actually pulling the paint downwards towards the real floor, but due to the inverted orientation of the filming setup, this downward fall is presented as upward movement on screen."
1206-2,"Yes, the blue paint appears to be spilling upwards because the entire scene is filmed upside down. The man is inverted, and when he pours the paint, gravity pulls it downwards (in reality), which appears as upwards motion towards his face in the inverted video frame, creating the illusion."
1206-3,"**No**, the way the paint is spilling (downwards) is entirely normal and predictable according to the laws of gravity when a container is held upside down above someone. The spilling itself isn't unusual; it's the direct and expected result of gravity acting on the liquid when the container is inverted overhead."

1209-0,"The woman's speed cannot be determined from the final still photograph.

**Explanation:** A single still photograph freezes a moment in time. Calculating speed requires knowing the distance traveled over a specific time duration, neither of which can be measured from a single static image. While she was moving when the photo was taken, her speed *within* the frozen frame itself is effectively zero or simply indeterminate."
1209-1,"It is impossible to determine the speed of the woman from the final still image.

**Explanation:** A still photograph captures only a single instant in time. To calculate speed, you need to know the distance traveled over a specific period, neither of which can be measured from a static image. While the image implies motion occurred (the splash), it doesn't provide the data needed to quantify the rate of that motion (speed)."
1209-2,"**Yes.**

The photo composition creates an illusion of speed by freezing the peak action of the splash, capturing suspended water droplets and leaves in mid-air. This ""frozen motion"" technique, combined with the dynamic pose and the low camera angle emphasizing the impact, makes the moment appear energetic and fast, regardless of the woman's actual speed when stepping into the puddle."
1209-3,"Yes, the woman appears to be running quickly. Her leg position, with one knee lifted high in a typical running stride, combined with the large, forceful splash of water created as her foot impacts the puddle, indicates rapid movement rather than walking."
1209-7,C
1210-0,"**Answer:** The focus changes from the woman in the foreground to the photograph in the background.

**Explanation:** Initially, the woman observing the art is relatively more in focus. The camera then adjusts, shifting the plane of sharp focus away from her and onto the framed black and white photograph hanging on the wall, bringing the artwork into clear view while the woman becomes softer in the foreground."
1210-1,"The focus shifts to become sharper on the framed photograph in the background, pulling attention away from the out-of-focus person in the foreground and making the artwork the clear subject."
1210-2,"Yes, the focus of the video remains on the photograph of the two birds throughout the sequence.

The camera keeps the framed photograph as the central and most prominent visual element for the entire duration, with only slight shifts in angle, while the person in the foreground remains out of focus."
1210-3,"**No.**

**Explanation:** The focus remains consistently on the framed photograph in the mid-ground throughout the video clip. The person in the foreground stays out of focus, and there is no shift in the focal plane towards them."
1210-7,B
1214-0,"**Answer:** Crane Up / Ascending Shot

**Explanation:** The camera starts relatively close to the woman from an overhead perspective and moves vertically upwards, increasing the distance from her and revealing the wider context of the spiral staircase."
1214-1,"**Answer:** The camera moves upwards and pulls back (moves away vertically).

**Explanation:** The camera starts with a high-angle view relatively close to the woman lying on the green cushion at the bottom of the spiral staircase. It then smoothly ascends vertically while simultaneously increasing its distance from the subject, effectively pulling back along the vertical axis. This movement reveals more and more of the surrounding spiral staircase architecture, transitioning the shot from a medium-high angle to an extreme high-angle or bird's-eye view."
1214-2,"Yes, the camera moves closer to the woman, creating a zoom-in effect. This is evident as the video starts with a wider shot showing more of the spiral staircase and then transitions to a much tighter frame focusing primarily on the woman lying on the green padding, making her appear larger."
1214-3,"Yes, the camera is moving away from the woman, creating a zoom-out effect.
*   **Explanation:** The video starts with a relatively close view of the woman on the green padded surface. As the video progresses, the camera physically moves upwards and backwards, revealing more of the surrounding spiral staircase. This movement increases the distance between the camera and the subject, making the woman appear smaller in the frame and widening the field of view, which is visually equivalent to a zoom-out."
1214-7,C
1223-0,"The camera view is closer or zoomed in for the last throw compared to the previous ones. This results in a tighter shot that focuses more intensely on the man, the pans, and the target cup, whereas the earlier throws were shown from a wider perspective."
1223-1,"For the final throw, the camera moves to a lower position, closer to the floor level. The framing also becomes tighter on the action area (pans and cup) compared to the slightly higher and wider angle used for the earlier throws."
1223-2,"Yes, the camera zooms in on the floor during the last throw. Unlike the previous stationary, wider views, the final throw features a tighter frame that focuses more closely on the pans, the ball's trajectory, and the target cup."
1223-3,"No, the camera angle does not change during the last throw. The camera maintains a fixed position and angle throughout the entire video clip."
1223-7,D
1225-0,"**The short male friend (the man in the grey shirt and black shorts).**

**Explanation:** After the taller man enters, the camera zooms slightly as the shorter man (wearing a grey shirt and black shorts) steps fully inside. This zoom frames him and the woman greeting him, making him the central visual focus, particularly highlighting his surprised facial expression."
1225-1,"**The shorter man / The visiting friend:**

He is the second person to enter the house, identified by the caption as the ""short friend"". The camera zooms in specifically on him, centering him in the frame as he stands just inside the doorway with a surprised expression."
1225-2,"Yes, the person mainly visible after the camera shifts focus from the doorway is a man wearing a gray t-shirt with the Under Armour logo. He becomes the central focus as he explores the house."
1225-3,"No, the person mainly visible after the first camera zoom is a man wearing a grey t-shirt and black shorts."
1225-7,C
1229-0,"The object in front of the mirror (a pawn) is different from its reflection (a king) because the video has been digitally manipulated. This was likely achieved through **video editing** or **compositing**, where the actual reflection of the pawn was replaced with an image of the king in post-production, or potentially using a specialized **phone app feature** designed to create such visual effects. The final image showing the impossible reflection is not a real-time, unedited capture of reality."
1229-1,"**Answer:** Object Swap / Physical Substitution

**Explanation:** The discrepancy occurs because the pawn initially placed in front of the mirror was physically swapped with a king chess piece. The mirror accurately reflects the king, which was the object present in front of it when the final reflection was captured. This is a staged illusion achieved by manually changing the object."
1229-2,"Yes, the difference is due to the panoramic (or similar motion-based) photography feature combined with a trick. The phone captures the scene sequentially as it moves. While the phone was moving and capturing, someone swapped the pawn behind the mirror with a king. The final image stitches together the pawn (captured initially) and the king (captured later in the position of the reflection)."
1229-3,"**Answer:** No.

**Explanation:** The difference between the object (pawn) and its reflection (king) is not because the mirror is a special type like a concave mirror. Mirrors, regardless of their shape (flat, concave, convex), reflect the light from the object placed in front of them. While they can change the size, orientation, or apparent distance of the reflection, they cannot change the fundamental identity or shape of the object itself. A mirror reflecting a pawn will show an image derived from the pawn, not a completely different piece like a king. The effect seen in the video is achieved through digital editing, a composite image, or some other form of visual trickery, not through the optical properties of the mirror."
1229-7,A
1231-0,"The water appears to flow backward because the final shot focuses on the **reflection** of the waterfall in the puddle, and the entire video has been **rotated 90 degrees**.

**Explanation:** Reflections invert images vertically (upside down). When the camera films this inverted reflection and the video is then rotated 90 degrees, the downward flow of water in the reflection appears as an upward flow in the final orientation, creating the illusion that it's moving backward against gravity."
1231-1,"The waterfall appears to flow in reverse because the final shot is actually the **reflection** of the waterfall captured in the puddle on the ground. This reflected image was then **rotated 180 degrees**. Since reflections are naturally inverted, rotating the footage makes the upside-down reflection appear right-side up, and consequently, the water that was flowing downwards in the reflection now appears to be flowing upwards."
1231-2,"**Yes**, the backward (upward) flow of the waterfall at the end of the video is due to reverse video processing.

**Explanation:** Water naturally flows downwards due to gravity. The visual of the waterfall flowing upwards is achieved by playing the recorded video segment in reverse, creating an illusion that defies physics."
1231-3,"**No**, the waterfall does not appear to flow backwards because of special effects.

**Explanation:** The effect is an optical illusion created by filming the *reflection* of the waterfall in the puddle and then rotating the video footage. The reflection is naturally inverted, so when the video showing the reflection is rotated, the water appears to flow upwards against gravity."
1231-7,D
1233-0,"The image shows one reflection and the actual person, not two reflections.

**Explanation:** This effect is created using the phone's **vertical panorama mode**. The photographer started by aiming the camera at the puddle to capture the **reflection**, then slowly tilted the phone upwards to capture the **actual person** kneeling above the puddle. The phone's software then **stitched** these two sequentially captured views into a single, seamless vertical image."
1233-1,"The photo was taken using the phone's panoramic mode. This mode captures the scene sequentially as the phone is moved. The man was present and reflected in the puddle when the panoramic capture began; his reflection was recorded then. He walked away *during* the capture process, but the woman remained. As the phone continued its sweep, it captured her reflection. The final image is a composite stitched together from these different moments, thus including the reflection of the man from the beginning of the capture and the reflection of the woman from a later point in the capture."
1233-2,"Yes, the video shows the photographer using the phone's panoramic camera function. This mode works by combining multiple images captured as the phone is moved vertically (while held upside down). This process creates a taller final image than a single shot, allowing the photographer to include the kneeling subject, the extensive sky reflection, and the reflections of both individuals in the puddle within one frame."
1233-3,"**No**, the effect is not due to image synthesis technology in the sense of generating fake content.

**Explanation:** As shown in the video and confirmed by the provided answers, the photo is created using the phone's **inverted panorama mode**. The photographer holds the phone upside down close to the puddle. The panorama function captures both the real scene above and its natural reflection in the water below. Because the phone is upside down during the panoramic sweep (likely vertical), the final stitched image presents the actual scene inverted on top, mirroring the natural reflection captured from the puddle's surface below it."

1235-0,"**Answer:** 37

**Explanation:** The pattern observed in the video is that the result is formed by concatenating the second number (b) with the sum of the two numbers (a+b). For `4 + 3`, the second number is 3, and the sum is `4 + 3 = 7`. Concatenating 3 and 7 gives 37."
1235-1,"**Answer:** 37

**Explanation:** The pattern shown in the video is that for an equation A + B = Result, the Result is formed by concatenating the second number (B) with the sum of the two numbers (A+B).

*   2 + 2: Second number is 2, Sum is 4 -> 24
*   3 + 3: Second number is 3, Sum is 6 -> 36
*   4 + 5: Second number is 5, Sum is 9 -> 59

Applying this pattern to 4 + 3:
*   Second number is 3.
*   Sum is 4 + 3 = 7.
*   Concatenating 3 and 7 gives 37."
1235-2,"**Yes, 4 + 3 = 37.**

**Explanation:** The pattern consistently shown in the video is to take the second number (b) and concatenate it with the sum of the two numbers (a+b). For 4 + 3, the second number is 3, and the sum (4+3) is 7. Concatenating these gives 37."
1235-3,"**No.**

**Explanation:** The pattern shown in the video is to concatenate the second number (b) with the sum of the two numbers (a+b).
*   2 + 2: Second number is 2, sum is 4 -> 24
*   3 + 3: Second number is 3, sum is 6 -> 36
*   4 + 5: Second number is 5, sum is 9 -> 59

Applying this pattern to 4 + 3:
*   Second number is 3, sum is (4+3)=7.
*   Concatenating gives 37.

Therefore, according to the pattern, 4 + 3 = 37, not 412."

1236-0,"Yes, the method is useful and produces the correct calculation result for the specific type of problem shown (dividing a multiple of 10 by 5).

This trick works because dividing by 5 is mathematically equivalent to multiplying by 2 and then dividing by 10. The method shown reverses this order: it first divides by 10 (by removing the trailing zero) and then multiplies the remaining number by 2, yielding the correct answer."
1236-1,"Yes, the method demonstrated in the video effectively yields accurate calculation results for the specific examples shown. The trick works because dividing by 5 is mathematically equivalent to multiplying by 2 and then dividing by 10. For numbers ending in zero (like 10, 30, 60, 90), removing the zero performs the division by 10, and multiplying the remaining digit by 2 completes the equivalent operation."
1236-2,"Yes, the method shown in the video is effective in producing accurate results for the division problems presented.
**Explanation:** The trick works because dividing a number (N) by 5 is mathematically equivalent to multiplying the number by 2 and then dividing by 10 (N ÷ 5 = (N * 2) / 10). For numbers ending in zero, like those shown, removing the zero effectively divides the number by 10. Multiplying the remaining digit by 2 completes the calculation, yielding the correct answer."
1236-3,"No, the method shown in the video is effective for dividing multiples of 10 by 5, but it does not involve squaring the numbers. The method involves removing the trailing zero (effectively dividing by 10) and then multiplying the remaining digit by 2, which is mathematically equivalent to dividing the original number by 5 (since N/5 = 2N/10)."
1236-7,C
1237-0,"Based on the pattern in the video:

*   4 + 4 = 4 * (4 - 2) = 4 * 2 = 08
*   5 + 5 = 5 * (5 - 2) = 5 * 3 = 15
*   6 + 6 = 6 * (6 - 2) = 6 * 4 = 24

Applying this pattern `x + x = x * (x - 2)` to the final question:

*   9 + 9 = 9 * (9 - 2) = 9 * 7 = **63**

**Answer:** 63
**Explanation:** The pattern is to multiply the number by itself minus 2. For 9 + 9, this is 9 * (9 - 2) = 9 * 7 = 63."
1237-1,"**Answer:** 63

**Explanation:**
The pattern observed in the equations is `a + a = a * (a - 2)`.
Applying this to the final question: `9 + 9 = 9 * (9 - 2) = 9 * 7 = 63`."
1237-2,"Yes, based on the pattern in the video, 9 + 9 results in 63.

**Explanation:**
The pattern observed in the equations is `a + a = a * (a - 2)`.
*   4 + 4 = 4 * (4 - 2) = 4 * 2 = 8
*   5 + 5 = 5 * (5 - 2) = 5 * 3 = 15
*   6 + 6 = 6 * (6 - 2) = 6 * 4 = 24
Applying this pattern to 9 + 9:
*   9 + 9 = 9 * (9 - 2) = 9 * 7 = 63."
1237-3,"**No.**

According to the pattern in the video, `a + a = a * (a - 2)`. Therefore, 9 + 9 = 9 * (9 - 2) = 9 * 7 = 63."

1239-0,"Yes, the calculation method shown is valid and produces the correct results for the 19 times table from 1 to 10."
1239-1,"**Yes**, the method shown yields accurate calculation results for the 19 times table from 1 to 10. The pattern involves writing the first ten odd numbers (1, 3, 5,... 19) and then appending the digits 9 down to 0 to complete the correct products (19, 38, 57,... 190)."
1239-2,"Yes, the method is effective in producing the correct results for the multiplication table of 19 (from 1 to 10). The method involves writing the units digits downwards from 9 to 0, and writing the tens digits (and hundreds where applicable) upwards using consecutive odd numbers starting from 1."
1239-3,"**No.**

**Explanation:** The method shown correctly produces the results for the 19 times table from 1 to 10 by following a simple pattern (writing odd numbers 1-19 and descending digits 9-0). However, it is generally *not as efficient* as standard multiplication or mental math tricks (like calculating 19 x N as (20 x N) - N) for finding a *single* specific product quickly, as the pattern method relies on generating the sequence. Its efficiency is highest only when the specific goal is to write out the entire list from 19x1 to 19x10 sequentially."

1242-0,"The result of the man's magic show was that the money disappeared from under the cup and then reappeared unexpectedly on the table next to where the cup was. The woman discovered the reappeared money, reacting with surprise."
1242-1,"The man successfully performed a sleight-of-hand trick using the cup, making the rolled-up money disappear from under it. The money then reappeared on the table (revealed by the woman), causing her to react with surprise."
1242-2,"Yes, the man's magic trick succeeded in surprising the woman. When she lifts the cup herself at the end, she finds a rolled-up banknote instead of the original object, and her facial expression immediately changes to one of clear surprise, with wide eyes and an open mouth."
1242-3,"Yes, the man's magic trick failed because the object (the rolled-up bill) remained on the table instead of disappearing as intended by the magic trick."

**Explanation:** In the video, the voice calls out several colors (Red, Pink, Orange). The man in the blue shirt only runs underneath the parachute immediately after the voice calls out ""Yellow""."
1255-2,"Yes, the man ran underneath the parachute after the color yellow was called. The video shows him running under the parachute immediately after the word ""yellow"" is announced around the 0:25-0:26 mark."

1260-0,"The man in white looks surprised because he witnessed the other man have an immediate, severe, and physically negative reaction to the exact same food he himself just ate without such drama. He's caught off guard by the stark contrast, suddenness, and intensity of the other man's discomfort and apparent repulsion to the food."
1260-1,"The man in white appears shocked primarily due to the **unexpected severity and suddenness** of the man in black's negative reaction to the food, especially given the **stark contrast** to his own seemingly less intense experience. He is likely surprised by how intensely his friend reacted, possibly confirming his own feeling that the food was extremely spicy, combined with **empathy or disbelief** at his friend's immediate distress."
1260-2,"**No.** The man in white is not surprised. The man in black did not eat all the food; he took one bite and reacted negatively, likely because the food was too spicy or unpleasant, while food clearly remained on the plate. The man in white shows no reaction of surprise."
1260-3,"**No**, the man in white appears calm and composed after eating the food. His reaction contrasts sharply with the man in black, who shows clear signs of distress from the spiciness, suggesting the man in white was not surprised or overwhelmed by the heat."

1261-0,"The two men were part of the photoshoot setup, intentionally positioned near the base of the tree holding torches. The mirror was placed on the ground and angled specifically to capture their reflection, creating a layered, artistic composition for the final photograph, even though they weren't sitting next to the woman reading above the mirror."
1261-1,"The final image is a composite created using digital editing techniques. The scene shown in the reflection (the two men with torches and smoke at the base of the tree) was staged separately during the photoshoot. This staged reflection was then digitally combined or inserted into the mirror area of the photograph featuring the woman reading, creating a surreal image that doesn't represent a literal, single-shot reflection."
1261-2,"Yes, the presence of two men in the reflection, which differs significantly from the scene above the mirror (woman reading, another man throwing papers), strongly suggests the final image is a composite, created by intentionally shooting separate elements and editing them together."

1262-0,"The girl appears **scared, startled, and upset**.

**Explanation:** She likely thought the performer was an inanimate statue. When she touched him, the realization that he was a person (or perhaps a perceived slight movement) startled and frightened her, leading to her crying and distressed reaction."
1262-1,"Based on the video, the girl felt **startled, shocked, and scared** when the performer moved unexpectedly after she grabbed his arm. This surprise and fear caused her to become immediately **upset and distressed**, resulting in intense crying."
1262-2,"**Yes, the girl appeared worried and scared after holding the performer's arm.** Her immediate reaction was to start crying loudly with a distressed facial expression, indicating she was frightened or startled by the interaction, likely upon realizing the ""statue"" was a real person."

1275-1,"**The man in the red shirt** is the winner.

**Explanation:** The challenge involves adding water to the glass without causing it to spill. The man in the blue shirt takes the final turn and causes the water to overflow. Therefore, the man in the red shirt, who took the turn immediately before him and successfully added water without spilling, is the winner."
1275-2,"Yes, the person in the blue T-shirt lost the challenge while the others won.

**Explanation:** The challenge involved adding water to a glass, relying on surface tension to keep it from spilling even when filled above the brim. The person in the blue T-shirt added the final drops that broke the surface tension, causing the water to overflow. Since they were the one to cause the spill, they lost the challenge, and the others who successfully added water without spilling won."
1275-3,"No, the person in the blue shirt did not win the challenge. They were the one adding water when the surface tension broke and the glass overflowed (around 0:49), which typically signifies losing in this type of game."

**Explanation:** Each icon represents a stage of the challenge, corresponding to the lemon-shaped candy being eaten. The candies increase in size with each participant. As a participant successfully eats their candy, a green checkmark appears over the corresponding lemon icon, visually marking the completion of that stage and tracking the overall progress through the challenge sequence."

**Explanation:** The video specifies that the second challenge took ""First try"" (1 attempt), but it only provides the time spent (""16 hours"") for the first challenge, not the number of attempts made during that time. Therefore, the necessary information to calculate the difference is missing."
1278-1,"**Cannot be determined:** The first challenge shown (""16 hours"") does not state the number of attempts, only the time taken. The second challenge took 1 attempt (""First try""). Therefore, the difference in the number of attempts cannot be calculated from the information provided for the first two sequential challenges."
1278-2,"No, the difference is not one. The second challenge explicitly states ""First try"" (1 attempt), while the first challenge took ""16 hours"", implying significantly more attempts were made, making the difference much larger than one."
1278-3,"**Yes.** The first challenge took 16 hours, implying a very large number of attempts, while the second challenge explicitly took only 1 attempt (""First try""). The difference between a large number of attempts and 1 attempt is certainly greater than two."

1283-0,"The runner wearing number 237 is running the fastest at the end of the video.

**Explanation:** This runner, wearing a red and white uniform, takes a clear lead shortly after the start and is significantly ahead of the other competitors as they approach the curve near the end of the clip, indicating they possess the highest speed among the group shown."
1283-1,"**Fastest Runner:** The boy wearing number 237.
**Explanation:** He takes the lead shortly after the start and is significantly ahead of the other runners by the end of the video clip."
1283-2,"Yes, the child in the red outfit, positioned in the middle of the five runners, quickly takes the lead and is significantly ahead of the other runners by the end of the video clip, indicating they are the fastest."
1283-3,"**Answer:** No, the child in the green outfit is not the fastest runner at the end of the video.

**Explanation:** At the end of the video clip, the child in the green outfit is visibly trailing behind the other runners, particularly the child in the red/maroon outfit (number 237) who is clearly in the lead as they round the curve."

1288-0,"The blond man's emotion at the end is best described as **Caught/Busted and Sheepish/Awkward**.

**Explanation:** After revealing the nunchucks behind the woman's back (a mischievous act), she turns around suddenly. His wide-eyed grimace suggests he's been ""caught"" in his prank, leading to a sheepish or awkward reaction as he faces her (and the camera)."
1288-1,"Based on the video, the blond man feels **surprised, startled, and caught off guard** at the conclusion.

**Explanation:** He was performing playful, dramatic moves with the towel towards the woman's back. When she suddenly turns around revealing the sticks, his eyes widen, his mouth opens slightly, and he freezes momentarily, indicating he was completely unprepared for her reaction and the reveal of the ""weapons."""
1288-2,"Yes, the blond man feels frustrated because the woman turns around and reveals the stick holding up the towel, exposing the secret behind his magic trick and ruining the illusion he was trying to create."

1290-0,"The man reacts with **shock** and **surprise**.

**Explanation:** As the woman throws the pillow upwards, the man's eyes widen significantly, his jaw drops, and his mouth opens wide as he looks up at the pillow's unexpected trajectory. This combination of facial expressions clearly indicates a state of shock or astonishment."
1290-1,"**Answer:** He reacts with shock and disbelief.

**Explanation:** At the conclusion of the video, when the pillow unexpectedly sticks to the ceiling, the man looks upwards with his eyes wide open and his mouth agape, clearly showing shock and disbelief at what just happened."
1290-2,"Yes, the man shows signs of shock. His eyes widen significantly, and his mouth opens wide in a gasp or expression of surprise immediately after the pillow unexpectedly rebounds and hits him."
1290-3,"**No:** The man's expression at the end, characterized by wide eyes and an open mouth, indicates shock or surprise rather than amusement or entertainment."

1293-0,"The bottle cap is suspended by a thin string held by someone off-camera or just above the frame. The behind-the-scenes footage shows a person holding the string to position the cap for the photo, creating the illusion that it is flying."
1293-1,The bottle cap was suspended using a thin string or thread. This is clearly shown in the behind-the-scenes setup footage (0:06-0:07) where the cap is dangling in front of the model before the final shot is taken. Water was also sprayed to create droplets and add a dynamic effect.
1293-2,"**Yes.** The video clearly shows the setup for the second scene where the bottle cap is suspended in the air using a thin string. The photographer then uses a low camera angle, combined with the water being sprayed, to capture the shot in a way that makes the string difficult or impossible to see in the final image, creating the illusion of the cap flying."
1293-3,"No, the bottle cap was not flicked by a finger. The video clearly shows in the behind-the-scenes setup (around 0:06-0:08) that the bottle cap was suspended from a thin string or wire, and water was sprayed onto it to create the effect of motion and flying droplets for the photograph."

1294-0,"Based on the narrative in the video, the meat appeared on the grill because the editing juxtaposes the scene of meat being cut in the hot air balloon with the meat suddenly landing on the grill below. This sequence implies the meat was dropped or thrown from the balloon, a conclusion reinforced by the chef looking upwards as the meat arrives."
1294-1,"**Answer:** The meat was dropped onto the grill from above.

**Explanation:** The chef is grilling corn when the meat suddenly appears on the grill. His immediate reaction is to look upwards in surprise, strongly indicating the meat came from an overhead position."
1294-2,"**No.**

**Explanation:** The video uses editing to connect two unrelated clips for comedic effect. The first clip shows one person slicing meat in a hot air balloon, while the second clip shows a different person grilling when a steak suddenly appears on the grill. The types of meat appear different, and the physics involved make it virtually impossible for a piece of meat dropped from that altitude to land so precisely."
1294-3,"**No.**

**Explanation:** The video shows the chef using tongs to place corn on the grill. However, the piece of meat appears suddenly on the grill while the chef is turned away and not actively using tongs for that purpose. His surprised reaction further indicates he did not place the meat there himself using tongs."

1298-0,"The man's football did not return to him because when he threw it, it hit the stone wall low down, near its base, and immediately struck the blue barrel positioned right next to the wall, stopping its momentum."
1298-1,"**Answer:** The football did not return to the man because he kicked it away from himself towards the wall, and the angle at which the ball hit the wall caused it to rebound in a direction away from him, following the basic physics of collisions."
1298-2,"**No.**

**Explanation:** The video shows the football hitting the wall *next to* the blue bucket and bouncing off. The footage cuts before the ball's final resting place is visible, so it cannot be confirmed if it landed inside the bucket."
1298-3,"Yes, the man's football was unable to return to him because a dog ran in and intercepted it after it bounced off the wall."
1298-7,D
1299-0,"The elevator door closed because the girl inside stopped holding it open, likely by releasing the 'door open' button or moving her hand away. This caused the elevator's automatic timer to expire and initiate the standard closing sequence, as no 'open' command or obstruction was being actively registered."
1299-1,"The girl inside the elevator pressed the ""close door"" button. Her hand moves near the control panel just before the door starts closing."
1299-2,"Yes, the elevator door closed automatically as the buffer time was up.

**Explanation:** The person inside the elevator is seen repeatedly pressing the 'door open' button, but the door begins to close anyway. This indicates that the elevator's programmed buffer time for holding the door open had expired, triggering the automatic closing sequence which overrides the manual button press."
1299-3,"**Yes.** The person inside the elevator moves their hand towards the control panel area immediately after seeing someone running towards the elevator, and the door begins to close right after this action, strongly indicating they pressed the 'close door' button."

1307-0,"The speed difference between the two tires became minimal or negligible after passing the ramp location.

**Explanation:** The FPV drone successfully flies through the center of both tires simultaneously *after* they have passed the location of the ramp. This maneuver would only be possible if both tires were traveling downhill at nearly identical forward speeds at that specific moment."
1307-1,"**Answer:** The speed difference between the two tires increases after they pass the ramp area.

**Explanation:** The larger tire maintains a higher speed and appears to pull further ahead of the smaller tire as they continue down the slope past the ramp location. This widening gap indicates that the difference in their speeds is growing."
1307-2,"Yes, the tire initially lagging behind eventually surpasses the leading tire in speed and distance after they pass the ramp area. Although both tires miss the ramp, the one that started second appears to take a more direct line or maintain momentum better on the flatter ground, allowing it to overtake the first tire."
1307-3,"**No**, the tire that takes the lead at the start does not remain in the lead all the time. The smaller tire catches up and runs alongside or slightly ahead of the larger tire partway down the hill."

1308-0,"**Answer:** The speed of the black missile appears constant in the animation.

**Explanation:** Throughout the segment where the black missile is visible (approximately 0:06 to 0:12), it travels across the screen at a steady rate without any noticeable acceleration or deceleration relative to the background or the bullet."
1308-1,"The missile accelerates rapidly after appearing, reaches a very high speed significantly faster than the bullet, and then visually appears to maintain this high speed for the remainder of its time on screen."
1308-2,"**Answer:** No.

**Explanation:** The animation shows the missile appearing next to the bullet and immediately accelerating rapidly past it. There is no visual indication that the missile decelerates or matches the bullet's speed; the purpose is to contrast their speeds by showing the missile quickly overtaking the bullet."
1308-3,"**Answer:** No.

**Explanation:** While the missile clearly accelerates significantly after launch to overtake the bullet and reach its stated top speed (Mach 7), the animation depicts it reaching this extremely high velocity rather than continuously accelerating throughout the entire duration shown. The final comparison, where the bullet looks almost stationary, suggests the missile is maintaining its peak speed, not constantly increasing it further."

1310-0,The man completed the game in less time. The video shows him placing his final ball into the hoop just slightly before the woman places hers.
1310-1,"**The man** finished the game in the shortest amount of time.

**Explanation:** The video shows the man placing his final ball into his hoop while the woman is still running to place her last ball, indicating he completed the task first."
1310-2,"No, Celine completed the game faster than Michiel. She placed her 6th ball into her hoop just before Michiel placed his 6th ball."
1310-3,"No, Celine did not finish the game faster. The soccer ball icons represent the number of balls collected by each player, acting as a score counter. Both Celine and the man collected 5 balls each, as indicated by the 5 icons above both their names at the end. However, the video shows the man finished collecting his 5 balls before Celine did, making him the faster player in this game."

1312-0,"Yes, the treadmill is running while the person is sleeping. This is evident because the person is sliding backward on the moving belt and has to reposition themselves."
1312-1,"Yes, the treadmill was active while the person was trying to sleep. The video shows the belt moving, which pulled the person and their blanket backward."
1312-2,"Yes, the person had to crawl forward to avoid falling off the treadmill because the belt was moving backward underneath them while they were ""sleeping""."
1312-3,"**Yes**, the treadmill belt was moving while the person was sleeping. The person, along with the pillow and blanket, can be seen slowly moving backward along the belt until the pillow falls off the end."
1312-7,C
1318-0,"**Answer:** Unimpressed, Nonplussed, and possibly Disappointed.

**Explanation:** The daughter maintains a neutral, unsmiling expression throughout her dad's performance. This suggests she is not amused or entertained by his antics (unimpressed). Her stillness and lack of reaction indicate she might be taken aback or unsure how to respond to his bizarre behavior (nonplussed). Furthermore, given she asked for a cat, his strange response could be interpreted as a 'no' or a way of trivializing her request, potentially leading to disappointment."
1318-1,"Based on the video, the daughter appears **unimpressed, annoyed, and exasperated** at the conclusion.

**Explanation:** Her neutral-to-negative facial expression, lack of laughter or engagement, and the way she looks away from her dad while he performs his cat impersonation suggest she is not amused by his antics and is likely irritated or exasperated by his response to her request for a cat."
1318-2,"**Answer:** No, the daughter does not seem truly speechless.

**Explanation:** Her expression appears more neutral, unimpressed, or resigned rather than shocked or overwhelmed. While she is silent, she lacks the strong emotional indicators (like wide eyes or an open mouth) typically associated with being rendered speechless by surprise or disbelief. Her reaction seems more like quiet exasperation or simply processing her father's absurd behavior."
1318-3,"**Yes.**

**Explanation:** At the end of the video, while her father is meowing behind her, the daughter turns her head slightly and displays a subtle smile, indicating she is amused or entertained by his antics."
1318-7,E
1321-0,"**Happy and Interested/Curious.**

**Explanation:** At the end of the video, the girl has a clear smile on her face, indicating happiness or pleasure. She is also looking directly towards the person filming with open eyes, suggesting she is interested in or curious about what the person is doing or saying."
1321-1,"Based on the video, the girl with braids feels **happy, friendly, and engaged** at the conclusion.

**Explanation:** She turns towards the person filming and gives a clear, direct smile, indicating happiness, friendliness, and awareness of/engagement with the camera or the person behind it."
1321-2,"**No.**

At the end of the video, the girl with braids is looking upwards in the same direction as the man and the rest of the crowd, with a slight smile and an attentive expression. This indicates she is engaged with an external event they are all watching, rather than being dazed or confused by the man's actions. Her focus aligns with his, suggesting a shared experience."
1321-3,"Yes, the girl with braids appears happy at the end of the video. She is looking towards the person filming with a clear smile on her face."
1321-7,A
1324-0,"**Mood:** Shocked/Surprised.

**Explanation:** Both the man and woman display wide-eyed, open-mouthed expressions of shock and surprise in the final moment. This reaction is caused by the small white dog, which the woman just handed to the man, apparently doing something unexpected and likely unpleasant (such as peeing or pooping) on the man right after he took hold of it."
1324-1,"**Emotion:** Both the man and woman appear shocked and startled at the conclusion of the video.

**Cause:** Their shock is caused by the sudden interruption or realization that occurs just as the man tenses up, seemingly about to break the live dog in half, mirroring his previous actions with inanimate objects. The comedic pattern escalated to a potentially harmful act towards the pet, and the abrupt halt creates the startled reaction."
1324-2,"**Yes, the man and woman experience shock at the end of the video.**

**Explanation:** After the woman hands the man the small white dog prop, the man pulls it, causing it to split into two halves. Both the man and the woman immediately react with wide eyes and open mouths, which are clear visual indicators of shock and surprise at the unexpected outcome resulting from the man's action."
1324-3,"**Yes**, the man and woman appear to be in a light-hearted and playful mood at the end of the video.

**Explanation:** The interaction follows a pattern of the couple swapping items with exaggerated reactions set to music, establishing a comedic premise. The man's sudden, theatrical shock upon being handed the fluffy dog, and the woman's corresponding surprised expression, fit this established playful dynamic. The use of a small dog, the exaggerated reactions, and the abrupt comedic ending strongly suggest the mood is intentionally light-hearted and humorous rather than genuinely alarmed."
1324-7,C
1329-0,"**Mood:** Playful and possibly startled into amusement.

**Why:** The woman is initially resting in a yoga pose. When the man abruptly gets up from the couch and moves towards her, she instantly springs up and runs away. Her quick, energetic reaction isn't one of fear or anger, but rather suggests she was surprised by his sudden movement and immediately engaged in what appears to be a spontaneous, lighthearted game of chase."
1329-1,"**Mood:** Startled and Annoyed/Flustered.
**Cause:** The man suddenly jumps up from the couch and runs towards her, interrupting her stretch and catching her completely off guard."
1329-2,"**No**, the woman's mood does not reflect frustration or anger. Her reaction of immediately getting up, chasing the man, and playfully hitting him indicates amusement or mock annoyance within a lighthearted interaction, rather than genuine negative emotion. The overall tone is playful."
1329-3,**Yes.** The man's action of briefly sitting down before suddenly running away is unexpected and lacks clear context. The woman's immediate response of getting up from her yoga pose and chasing him strongly suggests she was surprised and confused by his abrupt behaviour and likely curious about the reason for his sudden departure.
1329-7,D
1344-0,"The baby smiles after the injection primarily due to the **sudden relief from the brief, sharp pain**. This immediate cessation of discomfort, combined with the baby's natural capacity for **rapid emotional shifts** and the **comfort and security** provided by being held by the parent, allows the distress to pass quickly. The smile likely reflects this relief, a return to their baseline state, and perhaps even surprise that the unpleasant experience was over so fast."
1344-1,"The baby likely smiles due to a combination of factors:
1.  **Relief/Surprise:** The sharp pain from the injection stopped abruptly, leading to a sense of relief, possibly mixed with surprise that the unpleasant event was so brief.
2.  **Social Interaction/Referencing:** After the crying stops and the bandage is applied, the baby looks up at the caregiver, observes their positive facial expression (smiling, relief), and mirrors this positive emotion, reinforced by the secure hold and comforting presence."
1344-2,"Yes. The baby cries due to the sharp pain of the injection. Once the needle is removed, the immediate pain subsides, leading to the cessation of crying. This relief allows the baby's emotional state to shift rapidly from distress, making it possible for them to smile shortly afterward, likely also influenced by processing the event and interacting with the caregivers."
1344-3,"Yes, the smile is likely due, at least in part, to being comforted. Being held securely by a caregiver during and after a stressful or painful event like an injection provides reassurance and helps the baby regulate their emotions. This comfort likely facilitated the transition from crying due to pain to smiling once the immediate distress subsided and they felt safe."
