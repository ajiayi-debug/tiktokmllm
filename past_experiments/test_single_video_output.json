    "context": "Okay, here is a detailed, objective description of the video content:\n\nThe video takes place outdoors on a well-maintained grassy area, resembling a golf course practice area or a large lawn, under a cloudy sky. Trees and a tall hedge form the background. Text overlayed at the top reads \"POV - no object is safe\". The camera perspective is fixed, looking down the lawn towards two individuals standing near golf bags in the distance. In the foreground, various objects are placed sequentially on top of a post (initially wooden, later black).\n\n1.  **0:00 - 0:02 (Bell):** The foreground object is a copper-colored bell mounted on a wooden post. In the distance, a person (black top, white shorts) swings a golf club. Around 0:01, a golf ball flies into frame and strikes the bell directly, producing a clear ringing sound. The bell visibly moves from the impact. CV analysis notes proximity between two background figures (IDs 2 & 8) around 1.73s (Potential Contact: True, IoU: 0.684), consistent with them standing near each other.\n2.  **0:02 - 0:04 (Egg 1):** The bell is replaced by a brown egg balanced on a small tee atop the wooden post. The same person in the distance swings again. CV analysis notes proximity between two background figures (IDs 9 & 12) around 2.37s (Potential Contact: True, IoU: 0.375). Around 0:03, the golf ball hits the egg, causing it to shatter instantly, sending fragments flying.\n3.  **0:04 - 0:05 (Candle):** The object is now a lit white candle on the post. A different person (blue shirt, black shorts) takes the swing. Around 0:04, the golf ball hits the candle, extinguishing the flame and knocking the candle slightly.\n4.  **0:05 - 0:06 (Balloon):** A red balloon, possibly with \"Happy Birthday\" text, is tied to the post. The person in the blue shirt swings. CV analysis notes proximity between two background figures (IDs 27 & 32) around 5.47s and 5.53s (Potential Contact: True, IoU: 0.699 and 0.685 respectively). Around 0:05, the golf ball hits the balloon, popping it immediately.\n5.  **0:06 - 0:07 (Egg 2):** An egg is again placed on the tee/post. The person in the blue shirt swings. Around 0:06, the golf ball hits and shatters the egg.\n6.  **0:07 - 0:08 (Golf Ball 1):** A white Srixon golf ball is balanced on a black tee/post. A person in a white shirt and black shorts swings. Around 0:08, the incoming golf ball strikes the Srixon ball, knocking it cleanly off the tee.\n7.  **0:08 - 0:10 (Guinness):** A pint glass filled with a dark liquid (appears to be Guinness) sits on the black post. The person in the white shirt swings. Around 0:09, the golf ball hits the glass, shattering it and sending liquid and glass fragments flying.\n8.  **0:10 - 0:11 (Lightbulb):** A standard lightbulb is placed on the black post. A person in a black top and black shorts swings. Around 0:10, the golf ball hits the lightbulb, shattering it.\n9.  **0:11 - 0:12 (Chocolate Orange):** A round, foil-wrapped object with a blue \"Terry's\" sticker (resembling a Terry's Chocolate Orange) is on the black post. The person in the black top/shorts swings. Around 0:11-0:12, the golf ball hits the object, knocking it off the post. The person in the white shirt in the background raises their arms.\n10. **0:12 - 0:14 (Egg 3):** An egg is placed on the black tee/post. The person in the white shirt swings. Around 0:13, the golf ball hits and shatters the egg.\n11. **0:14 - 0:17 (Golf Ball 2):** A white Srixon golf ball is on the black tee/post. The person in the blue shirt swings. CV analysis notes proximity between two background figures (IDs 72 & 80) around 16.13s (Potential Contact: True, IoU: 0.656). Around 0:15, the incoming golf ball hits the Srixon ball, knocking it off the tee. The people in the background react visibly.\n\nThroughout the video, the golfers successfully hit the target object in the foreground with a golf ball on each attempt, resulting in the object being broken, moved, or otherwise directly affected by the impact. The CV analysis insights confirm close proximity between the individuals standing in the background at various points but do not relate directly to the primary ball-object impacts shown.",
    "is_contextual": true,
    "explanation": "Intent: The question asks for the total count of successful golf shots hitting the foreground target. Success Criterion: A successful hit is defined as the golf ball making contact with and visibly affecting the target object (e.g., breaking, moving, extinguishing, popping). Evidence: The 'Extracted Context' meticulously details 11 distinct attempts targeting different objects (bell, egg, candle, balloon, egg, golf ball, Guinness glass, lightbulb, chocolate orange, egg, golf ball). For each attempt, the context describes the golf ball striking the target and causing an effect (ringing, shattering, extinguishing, popping, knocking off, shattering, shattering, knocking off, shattering, knocking off). The context explicitly summarizes this: 'Throughout the video, the golfers successfully hit the target object in the foreground with a golf ball on each attempt...'. The 'CV Analysis Insights' and their associated 'LLM Verification' notes focus solely on the proximity and interactions between the people in the background and do not provide any information regarding the golf ball hitting the foreground targets. Reasoning: The visual description in the 'Extracted Context' consistently confirms a successful hit for all 11 attempts shown. The CV analysis is irrelevant to this specific question. Therefore, the question is contextually answerable based on the provided visual description.",
