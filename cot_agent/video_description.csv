The task at hand is to factor the polynomial \(3x^3 + x^2 - 15x - 5\). The hand begins by writing the problem statement at the top of the paper.

As the video progresses, the hand explains that since there are four terms in the polynomial, the Factoring by Grouping method will be used. The polynomial is then split into two groups: \((3x^3 + x^2)\) and \((-15x - 5)\).

Next, the hand factors out the greatest common factor from each group:
- From \((3x^3 + x^2)\), the greatest common factor is \(x^2\), resulting in \(x^2(3x + 1)\).
- From \((-15x - 5)\), the greatest common factor is \(-5\), resulting in \(-5(3x + 1)\).

The expression now becomes \(x^2(3x + 1) - 5(3x + 1)\). The hand then identifies that both terms have a common factor of \((3x + 1)\), allowing for factoring out this common factor:
\[x^2(3x + 1) - 5(3x + 1) = (x^2 - 5)(3x + 1).\]

The hand then notes that the term \(x^2 - 5\) can be further factored using the Difference of Squares formula, which states \(x^2 - y^2 = (x - y)(x + y)\). Here, \(x^2 - 5\) can be written as \(x^2 - (\sqrt{5})^2\), so it factors into \((x - \sqrt{5})(x + \sqrt{5})\).

Finally, the fully factored form of the polynomial is written as \((x - \sqrt{5})(x + \sqrt{5})(3x + 1)\), and the hand encircles this final expression with a red marker for emphasis.

Throughout the video, text overlays appear to provide additional explanations and formulas, such as ""We can further factor \((x^2 - 5)\) by noticing that it's a Difference of Squares,""","The video depicts a lively outdoor scene where a group of people is gathered around a wooden chopping block.
