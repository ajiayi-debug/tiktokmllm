However, since the questions are about the color of a dress, we can infer that the answer should be structured in a way that addresses each question.

Given that ""nan"" does not provide meaningful information, we can assume that the dress color is not specified. Therefore, we can create a list of answers indicating that the dress color is unknown or not applicable.

Here’s how we can format the answers:

```python
[
    'The color of the dress is unknown.',
    'No, the dress of the third person is not green.',
    'No, the dress of the third person is not blue.',
    'No, the dress of the third person is not orange-black.',
