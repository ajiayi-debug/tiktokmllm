The paper becomes saturated with water, changing its appearance and texture. Before submerging, the paper is dry and flat; after submerging, it is wet and possibly wrinkled or distorted. Ensuring a controlled transition might be to maintain the paper's shape and prevent damage. Maintaining the integrity of the image involves careful handling to avoid smudging or tearing. When the paper is completely wet, it may float or sink depending on its density and the water's movement.
