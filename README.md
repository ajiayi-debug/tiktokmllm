# Note: I just created two branches: dev and prod. Dev is for experimental testing while prod is for "production".

Suggested workflow:

Experimental/Testing stage:
Create new branch from dev w name and feature. Once tested to be production ready, push to dev. (need to trigger CI/CD?)

Prod:
push dev to prod
