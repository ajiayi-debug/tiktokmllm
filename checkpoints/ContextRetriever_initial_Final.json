The second person, a woman in an Adidas sweatshirt, taps the top of a Corona beer bottle with her finger. In both these instances, the bottle cap remains securely on the bottle. The third person, a man in a black shirt, first taps the top of a Coca-Cola bottle with a chopstick, then waves his hand over it, then taps the side of the bottle near the bottom with his knuckles, and finally waves his hand over the top again. After the final hand wave, the bottle cap pops off, and the soda fizzes.",

In the first clip, a man with a beard taps the cap of a glass bottle (appears to be Bundaberg Ginger Beer) with a small object, possibly a lighter or another cap.

In the third clip, a man attempts to open a Coca-Cola bottle. He first taps the cap with a chopstick, then tries flicking it with a folded piece of paper, taps it again with the chopstick, and finally makes a sweeping hand gesture towards the bottle, after which the cap appears to fly off. This final action seems like a magic trick or video edit rather than using a physical tool like a knife.",
